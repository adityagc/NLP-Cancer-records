# NLP Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Electronic Health Records
This repository contains my work as a part of the NLP for Electronic records project. The data cannot be made public due to an NDA. This repository contains the details of the processing code and the machine learning algorithms used. The approach can be summarized as follows:

### 1)A custom bag-of-words was built from medical ontologies.
### 2)An ensemble of models such as Naive-Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forests was to achieve an accuracy of 94.09 % and F-score of 0.936.
### 3)A Flask-based web-app for cancer classification was deployed on Google Cloud Platform by my colleague Patrick McNellie.
