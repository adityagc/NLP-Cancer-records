A.  Received in formalin, labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M]."" and designated ""A.
Cecal cancer"", is a right colectomy consisting of an 11.5 cm long and 3
cm in diameter terminal ileum continuous with a 19 cm long and 3.5 cm in
diameter cecum and distal colon, stapled at both ends. The proximal
margin is inked blue and the distal margin is inked black. The attached
mesenteric and pericolic fat is 25 x 5 x 4 cm. A 6.5 cm long and 0.7 cm
in diameter appendix is identified. The serosa is dusky and hemorrhagic
with an abundant amount of adhesions/adherent clot surrounding the
cecum. There is a 3.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm edematous/cystic looking area with
central puckering at the cecum. This area is inked green. The radial fat
margin is inked orange. A 5.7 x 5.5 x 4 cm cecal mass is identified,
involving the ileocecal valve and the proximal end of the appendix. The
mass occupies the entire cecum and extends through the wall and into the
underlying fat. It is 4.5 cm from the radial fat margin (mesenteric), 9
cm from the proximal margin, and 11.5 cm from the distal margin. The
mass is circumferential and constricts the lumen up to 1 cm in diameter.
There is a 1 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm polypoid lesion identified distal to the
mass. The lesion is 2.5 cm distal to the mass, 3 cm distal to the
ileocecal valve, 13 cm from the proximal margin, and 10 cm from the
distal margin. The cut surface of the polyp appears to possibly extend
focally into the wall. The wall within this area is up to 0.8 cm in
thickness. No other tumors, polyps, or lesions are identified. The
mucosa distal to the mass and polypoid lesion is slightly edematous but
otherwise unremarkable. The fat is thoroughly searched for lymph nodes
and 22 nodes are identified up to 2 cm. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: A1 - longitudinal margins; A2 - radial fat margin
closest to mass, en face; A3 - mass in relation to appendiceal orifice

diameter portion of terminal ileum contiguous with a 17.5 cm long by 4.0
cm in average diameter segment of large bowel which includes cecum and
ascending colon, with a moderate amount of attached mesenteric adipose
tissue. The appendix is surgically absent. The serosa is purple-tan,
focally dusky with numerous membranous adhesions and is remarkable for a
2.5 x 2.5 cm focus of retraction and puckering 6.0 cm from the distal
resection margin. This focus is marked with silver nitrate. The specimen
is opened to demonstrate a 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.7 cm plaque-like mass lesion with
central ulceration and heaped-up borders. This mass lesion corresponds to
the aforementioned focus of serosal retraction and comes to within 3.8 cm
of the distal resection margin at closest approach and is grossly clear of
the proximal resection margin. Sectioning reveals gray-tan homogenous,
indurated cut surfaces and the maximum tumor thickness is 2.0 cm. The
lesion extends into and through the bowel muscularis and into the adjacent
mesenteric adipose tissue, grossly abutting the silver nitrate-marked
puckered, retracted serosa. Additionally, the specimen demonstrates four
brown-tan, granular, sessile mucosal polyps ranging from 0.4 cm up to 2.8
cm in greatest dimension which are located within the cecum.  The largest
lesion (2.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) focally abuts the ileocecal valve and
sectioning reveals brown-tan granular cut surfaces which are grossly
confined to the mucosa. No additional discrete lesions are noted and the
remaining, uninvolved bowel mucosa is tan, focally granular and
convoluted. The attached mesenteric adipose tissue is palpated, dissected

Several findings in this case suggest the likely possibility that this represents a microsatellite instable (MSI) tumor. These findings include the poorly differentiated/dedifferentiated histologic appearance of the tumor with accompanying mucinous and medullary features, the absence of identifiable lymph node metastases in a tumor of this size and differentiation, and the presence of several separate sessile serrated adenomas in the cecum.<DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS>

RIGHT COLON: 
(**INITIALS:cr) The specimen is received fresh from the operating room labeled with the patient's name and designated """"right colon."""" The specimen consists of an apparent hemicolectomy with 4 cm of terminal ileum resected in continuity with 19 cm of proximal colon. Both end surgical margins are open. The external surface of the bowel does not show definite tumor penetration. An unremarkable 4 x 0.4 cm appendix is present in its normal position. A variable amount of peribowel fatty tissue, mesentery and omentum is present. The bowel is opened longitudinally. Present in the cecum is an ulcered necrotic appearing tumor mass with maximum luminal dimension of 11.0 x 6.5 cm. The tumor appears to extend into the ileocecal valve. The distance from the tumor to the distal colonic and margin of resection is approximately 9 cm. On cut section the tumor shows invasion into and through the muscularis propria. The cecum also demonstrates 2 separate polyps measuring 0.4 cm in and 1.0 cm respectively. The terminal ileal mucosa does not evidence of polyps. The mesenteric and omental tissues appear unremarkable. Multiple pericolonic lymph nodes are isolated. 

Summary of sections: 1a-end surgical margins; 1b-cut mesenteric margin; 1c-appendix; 1d through 1h-tumor; 1i-cecal polyps; 1j-random colon; 1k-ileocecal valve and random terminal ileum; 1l-omentum; 1m, 1n-multiple intact lymph nodes; 1o-three bisected lymph nodes.

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name in three parts.
A. Labeled ""1. Sigmoid colon"" is a segment of colon measuring 20.0 cm in length and 3.2 cm in diameter, with attached yellow to red pericolic adipose tissue. The serosal surface is smooth, red to purple, with a firm depressed area measuring 4.0 x 2.2 cm, which is 4.0 cm away from the stapled end. This firm area is inked blue. There is attached red tissue present in this depressed firm area, measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. One end is open and the other end is stapled closed. Opening the colon reveals a circumferential pink to tan tumor with heaped up borders and a central gray ulceration, measuring 6.0 x 3.2 x 1.9 cm. The tumor is approximately 3.0 cm away from the stapled end (closest end). Sectioning through the tumor reveals that tumor grossly penetrates through the muscularis propria, extending into the underlying adipose tissue and abutting both inked serosa and the attached red tissue. The rest of the mucosa is soft tan to pink folds.
Sectioning through the pericolic adipose tissue reveals thirteen pink to red possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. 
Representative sections submitted in nine cassettes: A1-A3: tumor, including ink, A4-A5: tumor, including ink and attached red tissue, A6: tumor showing relation to adjacent mucosa towards the stapled end, A7: five intact nodes, A8: five intact nodes, A9: three intact nodes. 
B. Labeled ""2. Anastomotic donuts x 2 proximal and distal"" are two rings of intestine with red to tan mucosa, measuring 2.0 cm in diameter by 0.7 cm in length and 2.2 cm in diameter by 1.1 cm in length. Sectioning reveals tan to red cut surface, with suture material and staples present in the second ring of intestine. Gross only.

<GROSS> 
Received in two formalin-filled containers labeled '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173' and a 
requisition with '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000730173'. 
The first is designated 'mesentery nodule' and is a tan-red, firm nodule with attached 
yellow, roughened fat. The nodule measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is inked blue 
on the external surface and is quadrisected revealing yellow-brown, granular cut surfaces. 
Sectioning and palpation through the remaining fat reveals three tan-yellow, firm nodules 
measuring 0.5, 0.6 and 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections submitted in 
five cassettes. 
Summary of Sections: 
A1-A4 Quadrisected firm large nodule, blue-inked 
A5 Three smaller nodules found in attached fat 
The second is designated 'right colon' and consists of a segment of colon with attached 
terminal ileum. The colon measures 20.0 cm in length and up to 8.5 cm in circumference. 
The terminal ileum measures 6.5 cm in length and up to 3.0 cm in circumference. There is 
attached yellow-red pericolic fat. The serosal surface is smooth and purple. Both ends are 
stapled closed. The proximal margin is inked blue, the distal margin is inked green. 
Opening the colon reveals a well-circumscribed, tan-pink tumor with rolled up borders 
measuring 2.5 x 2.5 cm which is 7.0 cm from the proximal margin and 15.5 cm from the distal 
margin. The fat overlying the tumor is inked black. Sectioning through the tumor reveals 
that the tumor involves but does not grossly extend through the muscularis propria. The 
tumor abuts the ileocecal valve. The remaining mucosa is soft, tan-pink mucosal folds with 
approximately eight tan-pink possible polyps ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 cm in greatest 
dimension. These polyps are found throughout the colon, the closest one approximately 3.5 
cm from the distal margin. Sectioning and palpation of the attached pericolic fat reveals 
15 possible lymph nodes. The lymph nodes range from 1.1 cm to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. 
Eight lymph nodes are found adjacent to the tumor toward the proximal margin. 
Attached to the cecum is a vermiform appendix measuring 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in 
diameter. Sectioning reveals a lumen containing light tan, pale-pink fecal material. No

<HISTOLOGY COMMENT>



<GROSS>
The specimen is labeled ""left colon"" and is received in formalin. It consists of a previously opened segment of colon measuring 21 cm in length. Roughly in the center the colon is constricted and there is a circumferential 4.5 cm (in circumference) x 3 cm sessile polypoid tan to red-tan tumor mass which protrudes up to 1.5 cm above the surrounding mucosa. In the center of the mass there is an 8 mm perforation and the attached mesentery also has an adjacent 2 cm perforation. The colon on one side of the mass is dilated and its mucosal folds are markedly edematous; this side will be treated as proximal. The tumor is 10 cm from the proximal margin and 8 cm from the distal margin. Distal to the tumor the circumference measures up to 4.5 cm and the mucosal folds are also slightly edematous. Located 1.5 cm from the distal margin there is an additional small 2.2 cm firm ulcerated tan mass. Four small 2-3 mm tan sessile polyps are present in the distal portion of the colon, located from 3 to 4 cm from the main tumor mass, and on the proximal side there are approximately eight white to tan 2 up to 10 mm sessile polyps. The mesentery measures up to 7 cm in width, and there is also a 9 x 7.5 cm piece of attached finely lobulated adipose tissue which may represent omentum. On sectioning, the tumor appears to infiltrate transmurally, and is possibly present on the serosal surface in the area of the perforation. In areas where the wall is intact tumor is located approximately 5 cm from the mesenteric margin. Representative sections are submitted. Cassette summary: A1 - adjacent to stapled proximal margin; A2 - adjacent to stapled distal margin; A3 - entire small ulcerated mass near distal margin; A4 - polyps in distal portion of colon; A5  A6 - polyps in proximal portion of colon; A7 - tumor adjacent to perforation (two sections, one on either side of the perforation); A8 - tumor, intact; A9  A10 - tumor in area of possible attached omentum, with possible serosal nodule in A10; A11 - tumor-uninvolved colon interface; A12 - three lymph node candidates. The remainder of the mesenteric and possible omental fat is removed from the specimen and fixed overnight in lymph node-clearing fixative. Multiple lymph node candidates are then dissected out of the fat and submitted as five lymph node candidates each in cassettes A13-A16.

 BONE MARROW BIOPSY,  ASPIRATE SMEARS, AND
  PERIPHERAL BLOOD:  Hypercellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis, limited
  myeloid and erythroid maturation, numerous small hypolobated megakaryocytes,
  and markedly increased blasts, consistent with persistent acute myeloid
  leukemia (see comment).<DIAGNOSIS COMMENT(S)>
  The peripheral blood is pancytopenic with circulating blasts.  The marrow is
  hypercellular for age and for this time point post-chemotherapy, at roughly
  70% cellularity.  Numerous small, hypolobated megakaryocytes are seen.  The
  morphologic blast count is challenging due the marked left shift in both
  myeloid and erythroid maturation as well as the hypogranular nature of the
  myeloid precursors, but blasts are estimated at approximately 40% by
  morphology.  Mature myeloid and erythroid elements are rare.  Concurrent flow
  cytometry on the core biopsy (see ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) identified approximately 35%
  abnormal myeloid blasts.   These findings are consistent with extensive

COMMENT:
CD34-positive blasts comprise 0.52% of the total WBC and express CD34,
HLA-DR, CD117, CD13 (decreased), CD38, and do not express CD33, CD11b,
CD15, CD2, CD5, CD7, CD56, or CD64. The maturing myeloid population
shows reduced side scatter and mild dyssynchronous antigen expression
with respect to CD13 and CD16. The myelomonocytic population shows
increased CD56 expression.

By flow, the myeloid population comprises 91.2% of the total WBC, and
the monocyte population comprises 4.1% of the total WBC. Erythroid
precursors are reduced at 4.58% CD71-positive. B cells comprise only
0.1% of the total WBC and show polytypic surface immunoglobulin
expression. Hematogones are numerically reduced.

Preliminary results are discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Mar 2 12] at 1700.
Reviewed by: Dr. **NAME[YYY XXX]



Review of the peripheral smear shows a modest absolute lymphocytosis with many of the cells having increased cytoplasm that molds to adjacent red blood cells.  There is also a suggestion of a mild increase in parachromatin clearing.  
Flow studies show a population of CD19 positive cells co-expressing CD5, CD23 and dim monoclonal lambda light chain.  The cells are also positive with CD20 and CD22 and negative with all other antibodies utilized including CD38.  
These features are consistent with a monoclonal B lymphocytosis since the total absolute lymphocyte count is < 5,000 per  L (3202/ L).  Correlation with the clinical picture is suggested to determine whether there is any extramedullary tissue involvement.

The ThinPrep slide shows rare groups of atypical cells with features
concerning for possible neoplasm.  The patient's history of gastric
carcinoma was noted, so immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for antibodies
that are typically positive in gastric carcinoma were performed.  All of
those stains were negative as was the stain for mesothelial cells.  Thus
the numbers of atypical cells in this preparation are too small to be

(acb/jmk)

<MICROSCOPIC>
A.  Examination of the smears and cytospins reveals a cellular sample
with predominantly lymphocytes present. No epithelial cells are seen.
Occasional stromal fibrous tissue fragments are identified. Occasional
other inflammatory cells to include histiocytes and neutrophils are
present. The lymphocytes appear to be predominantly small
well-differentiated and occasional intermediate-sized lymphocytes
showing slight nuclear membrane irregularities. There is a small
population of large atypical lymphoid cells with nuclei containing
granular chromatin and no significant or prominent nucleoli.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate
controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific
fluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or
all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based
method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin
free multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the

FLOW CYTOMETRY:

<FINAL DX>

Right parotid mass/lymph node: Abnormal B-cell population identified
with immunophenotypic features consistent with Mantle cell lymphoma.
(see comment)

COMMENT:
Flow cytometry reveals an abnormal B-cell population expressing CD5,
CD19, and CD20, with kappa surface light chain restriction, without
CD23.  The abnormal B-cell population comprises 93.7% of the white blood
cells.  The immunophenotypic findings are consistent with recurrent
mantle cell lymphoma. However, documentation of cyclin D1 expression by
immunocytochemistry, or the t(11;14) by FISH could be considered for
confirmation.

The specimen consists of an 8\X0D\\X0A\x 7 x 3.5 cm portion of yellow-tan fibrofatty soft tissue.  The medial\X0D\\X0A\aspect of the specimen is partially surfaced by a pink-tan skin ellipse\X0D\\X0A\which is 3 x 0.5 cm.  The epidermal surface is pink-tan and grossly\X0D\\X0A\unremarkable.  There is a radiograph included with the specimen, and an\X0D\\X0A\indwelling needle localization wire is present.  The specimen is\X0D\\X0A\oriented on the Specboard with respect to the superior, inferior,\X0D\\X0A\medial, and lateral margins.  The specimen is also oriented with black\X0D\\X0A\ink on the anterior surface, and blue ink on the posterior surface.  The\X0D\\X0A\specimen is now further inked deep = blue, superficial = black.\X0D\\X0A\Sectioning the specimen reveals a 1.9 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm relatively\X0D\\X0A\well-circumscribed indurated mass within the medial half of the\X0D\\X0A\specimen.  The lesion has a solid white-tan cut surface.  The mass is\X0D\\X0A\0.7 cm from the superficial margin, 1 cm from the inferior margin, 1.5\X0D\\X0A\cm from the superior margin, 1.5 cm from the medial margin, and greater\X0D\\X0A\than 2 cm from the lateral margin.  Posterior to the main mass, there is\X0D\\X0A\a separate stellate lesion which is 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  This smaller\X0D\\X0A\lesion is possibly connected to the main mass, giving the lesional area\X0D\\X0A\an overall greatest dimension of 2.5 cm.  The separate small lesion\X0D\\X0A\abuts the deep margin.  There are no other distinct lesions identified.\X0D\\X0A\The lateral half of the specimen is notable for a moderate amount of\X0D\\X0A\dense white-tan fibrous tissue and abundant blue-domed cystic\X0D\\X0A\structures.  An intraoperative gross consult is performed.\X0D\\X0A\Representative sections are submitted as follows:\X0D\\X0A\A1 - medial margin\X0D\\X0A\A2 - lateral margin\X0D\\X0A\A3 and A4 - superior margin\X0D\\X0A\A5 and A6 - inferior margin\X0D\\X0A\A7 - superficial margin\X0D\\X0A\A8 through A12 - lesional area entirely submitted to include deep margin\X0D\\X0A\(nodule at deep margin included in cassettes A8 through A10);\X0D\\X0A\A13 through A14 - representative sections of dense fibrous tissue\X0D\\X0A\lateral to the mass.\X0D\\X0A\NOTE:  Part A sections are placed in formalin at 11:40 a.m. on **DATE[Nov 7 2011].\X0D\\X0A\Part B is received fresh additionally labeled ""sentinel node #1"".

There is no frozen section performed.  The lymph node is\X0D\\X0A\submitted entirely in cassette B.\X0D\\X0A\Part C is received fresh additionally labeled ""sentinel node #2"".  The\X0D\\X0A\specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.8  x0.7 cm pink-tan partially fatty\X0D\\X0A\replaced lymph node.  The lymph node is sectioned and submitted entirely\X0D\\X0A\in cassette C.\X0D\\X0A\JAB:jck","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\A)   The initial peripheral resections margins as designated are each\X0D\\X0A\benign, with the medial skin showing subcutaneous prior biopsy site\X0D\\X0A\changes.  The background breast shows proliferative fibrocystic changes\X0D\\X0A\with a few foci of columnar cell hyperplasia without atypia, and a small\X0D\\X0A\focus of intraductal papilloma formation.  Foci of sclerosing adenosis\X0D\\X0A\and scattered benign luminal microcalcifications are noted.  Sections of\X0D\\X0A\the tumor in relation to the deep margin show the smaller described\X0D\\X0A\nodular focus deep to the main tumor mass, to focally involve the inked\X0D\\X0A\and cauterized margin of resection (as noted grossly).  The majority of\X0D\\X0A\the tumor in this peripheral distribution shows small aggregates and\X0D\\X0A\single file linear arrays, focally circumscribing benign ductal\X0D\\X0A\elements, suggestive of lobular features.  However, the main tumor mass\X0D\\X0A\demonstrates areas of true tubule formation, overall compatible with a\X0D\\X0A\ductal morphology.  Prior biopsy site changes are again noted.  The\X0D\\X0A\majority of the tumor shows moderate to focally marked nuclear\X0D\\X0A\pleomorphism, with mitoses estimated at up to 2-3 in 10 high-power\X0D\\X0A\fields.  The tumor nests occasionally show retraction artifact with the\X0D\\X0A\surrounding stroma with a few scattered foci of angiolymphatic invasion\X0D\\X0A\identified.  A minor component of background ductal carcinoma in situ is\X0D\\X0A\noted, primarily of a cribriform morphology and of intermediate nuclear\X0D\\X0A\features.  The in situ tumor is seen spreading in adjacent and distant\X0D\\X0A\segmental ducts.  Slide ***PATH-NUMBER[1] also shows an adjacent intraductal\X0D\\X0A\papilloma, appearing partially sclerosed.  A few separated foci of\X0D\\X0A\atypical ductal hyperplasia are also noted, with a few separate < 1\X0D\\X0A\millimeter satellite tumor foci seen in slide ***PATH-NUMBER[2].  The dense breast\X0D\\X0A\tissue lateral to the mass shows similar proliferative fibrocystic\X0D\\X0A\changes with features suggestive of a very small, < 0.3 cm early radial\X0D\\X0A\scar noted.\X0D\\X0A\B)   Review of the touch preparation and permanent sentinel lymph node\X0D\\X0A\step-level sections shows a single benign serially divided lymph node\X0D\\X0A\with no evidence of metastatic tumor.\X0D\\X0A\C)   Review of the permanent sentinel lymph node levels shows a single\X0D\\X0A\serially divided benign lymph node with no evidence of metastatic tumor.\X0D\\X0A\Tissue Code:  T1.\X0D\\X0A\CASE SUMMARY FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST\X0D\\X0A\Specimen:  Breast\X0D\\X0A\Procedure:  Needle localized lumpectomy\X0D\\X0A\Lymph node sampling:  Sentinel nodes x 2\X0D\\X0A\Specimen laterality:  Right\X0D\\X0A\Specimen integrity:  Single intact specimen, margins can be assessed\X0D\\X0A\Specimen size:  8 x 7 x 3.5 cm\X0D\\X0A\Tumor site:  3:00 position (per ***PATH-NUMBER[3])\X0D\\X0A\Tumor size:  2.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm\X0D\\X0A\Tumor focality:  Multifocal (separate <1 mm satellite tumor foci noted)\X0D\\X0A\Histologic type of invasive carcinoma:  Ductal\X0D\\X0A\Histologic grade (Nottingham histologic score):\X0D\\X0A\Glandular/tubular differentiation:  3\X0D\\X0A\Nuclear pleomorphism:  2-3\X0D\\X0A\Mitotic count:  1\X0D\\X0A\Total score:  7\X0D\\X0A\Overall grade:  Moderately differentiated\X0D\\X0A\Extent of tumor:\X0D\\X0A\Skin:  Benign\X0D\\X0A\Nipple:  N/A\X0D\\X0A\Skeletal muscle:  N/A\X0D\\X0A\Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS):\X0D\\X0A\Size (extent) of DCIS:  \R\5% of tumor volume\X0D\\X0A\DCIS architectural patterns:  Cribriform\X0D\\X0A\DCIS nuclear grade:  Intermediate\X0D\\X0A\Necrosis:  Not observed\X0D\\X0A\Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):  Not identified\X0D\\X0A\Microcalcifications:  Yes - benign zones\X0D\\X0A\Margins:  Invasive tumor extends to focally involve the deeper resection\X0D\\X0A\margin only\X0D\\X0A\Lymph-vascular invasion:  Identified\X0D\\X0A\Dermal lymph-vascular invasion:  Not identified\X0D\\X0A\Lymph nodes:\X0D\\X0A\Number of sentinel lymph nodes examined:  2\X0D\\X0A\Total number of lymph nodes examined (sentinel and non-sentinel):  2\X0D\\X0A\Number of lymph nodes with macrometastases:  0\X0D\\X0A\Number of lymph nodes with micrometastases:  0\X0D\\X0A\Number of lymph nodes with isolated tumor cells:  0\X0D\\X0A\Size of largest metastatic deposit:  N/A\X0D\\X0A\Extranodal extension:  N/A\X0D\\X0A\Additional pathologic findings:  Proliferative fibrocystic changes,\X0D\\X0A\focal atypical ductal hyperplasia, intraductal papillomas, sclerosing\X0D\\X0A\adenosis\X0D\\X0A\Receptor studies:  To be performed on block A10, with the results to\X0D\\X0A\follow in an addendum\X0D\\X0A\Pathologic Staging:  pT2; pN0(sn); pMx.\X0D\\X0A\DRJ:jck\X0D\\X0A\D\T\T:  **DATE[Nov 08 2011].\X0D\\X0A\Addendum:\X0D\\X0A\Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors\X0D\\X0A\(PR), and HER-2/neu status were performed on block A10, with the\X0D\\X0A\following results obtained (adequate immunostain controls):\X0D\\X0A\Estrogen Receptor (ER) (semiquantitative) / Progesterone Receptor (PR)\X0D\\X0A\(semiquantitative)\X0D\\X0A\ER:  Positive   >95%; staining intensity (strong)\X0D\\X0A\PR:  Positive     80%; staining intensity (mild/moderate)\X0D\\X0A\Method and Scoring Guide for ER/PR:\X0D\\X0A\Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue.\X0D\\X0A\ER clone SP1\X0D\\X0A\PR clone 1E2.\X0D\\X0A\Scoring Guide:  A positive result is based specifically upon positive\X0D\\X0A\nuclear staining within tumor cells, with an intensity graded from\X0D\\X0A\weak-mild to strong as noted above.

The skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by tumor\X0D\\X0A\emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin\X0D\\X0A\biopsy.  However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an\X0D\\X0A\invasive carcinoma in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal\X0D\\X0A\lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PR, and HER2\X0D\\X0A\status.  Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes\X0D\\X0A\described above do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma.  Locally advanced\X0D\\X0A\breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the\X0D\\X0A\clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify\X0D\\X0A\as inflammatory carcinoma.  Thus the term inflammatory carcinoma should not be\X0D\\X0A\applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in\X0D\\X0A\the course of a patient's disease.  The rare case that exhibits all the features\X0D\\X0A\of inflammatory carcinoma, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third\X0D\\X0A\of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying\X0D\\X0A\carcinoma. \X0D\\X0A\Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) (choose a category based on lymph nodes received with\X0D\\X0A\the specimen; immunohistochemistry and/or molecular studies are not required)\X0D\\X0A\If internal mammary lymph nodes, infraclavicular nodes, or supraclavicular lymph\X0D\\X0A\nodes are included in the specimen, consult the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual1 for\X0D\\X0A\additional lymph node categories.\X0D\\X0A\Modifier (required only if applicable)\X0D\\X0A\     ___ (sn):     Only sentinel node(s) evaluated.

Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single\X0D\\X0A\dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in\X0D\\X0A\a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that\X0D\\X0A\more than 1000 cells are present in the node.  In these situations, the node\X0D\\X0A\should be classified as containing a micrometastasis (pN1mi).  Cells in\X0D\\X0A\different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the\X0D\\X0A\block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile\X0D\\X0A\even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices.  It is\X0D\\X0A\recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC\X0D\\X0A\and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories because of inherent\X0D\\X0A\limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden\X0D\\X0A\in lymph nodes.  Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a\X0D\\X0A\guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories.  The\X0D\\X0A\pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster\X0D\\X0A\of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of\X0D\\X0A\isolated tumor

The skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by tumor\X0D\\X0A\emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may not be obvious in a small skin\X0D\\X0A\biopsy.  However, a tissue diagnosis is still necessary to demonstrate an\X0D\\X0A\invasive carcinoma in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal\X0D\\X0A\lymphatics, as well as to determine biological markers, such as ER, PR, and HER2\X0D\\X0A\status.  Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin changes\X0D\\X0A\described above do not qualify as inflammatory carcinoma.  Locally advanced\X0D\\X0A\breast cancers directly invading the dermis or ulcerating the skin without the\X0D\\X0A\clinical skin changes and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify\X0D\\X0A\as inflammatory carcinoma.  Thus the term inflammatory carcinoma should not be\X0D\\X0A\applied to neglected locally advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in\X0D\\X0A\the course of a patient's disease.  The rare case that exhibits all the features\X0D\\X0A\of inflammatory carcinoma, but in which skin changes involve less than one-third\X0D\\X0A\of the skin, should be classified by the size and extent of the underlying\X0D\\X0A\carcinoma. \X0D\\X0A\Regional Lymph Nodes (pN) (choose a category based on lymph nodes received with\X0D\\X0A\the specimen; immunohistochemistry and/or molecular studies are not required)\X0D\\X0A\If internal mammary lymph nodes, infraclavicular nodes, or supraclavicular lymph\X0D\\X0A\nodes are included in the specimen, consult the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual1 for\X0D\\X0A\additional lymph node categories.\X0D\\X0A\Modifier (required only if applicable)\X0D\\X0A\     ___ (sn):     Only sentinel node(s) evaluated.

Thus, if more than 200 individual tumor cells are identified as single\X0D\\X0A\dispersed tumor cells or as a nearly confluent elliptical or spherical focus in\X0D\\X0A\a single histologic section of a lymph node, there is a high probability that\X0D\\X0A\more than 1000 cells are present in the node.  In these situations, the node\X0D\\X0A\should be classified as containing a micrometastasis (pN1mi).  Cells in\X0D\\X0A\different lymph node cross-sections or longitudinal sections or levels of the\X0D\\X0A\block are not added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node profile\X0D\\X0A\even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices.  It is\X0D\\X0A\recognized that there is substantial overlap between the upper limit of the ITC\X0D\\X0A\and the lower limit of the micrometastasis categories because of inherent\X0D\\X0A\limitations in pathologic nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden\X0D\\X0A\in lymph nodes.  Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single cross-section is a\X0D\\X0A\guideline to help pathologists distinguish between these 2 categories.  The\X0D\\X0A\pathologist should use judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster\X0D\\X0A\of cells represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group of\X0D\\X0A\isolated tumor

There is an inserted localizing wire including tip. \X0D\\X0A\The specimen margins are inked in blue.  Also received is a specimen radiograph\X0D\\X0A\of the circled area of concern which includes an inserted marker clips near the\X0D\\X0A\hook of the wire.  On sectioning, situated within the area of concern, is a 1.3\X0D\\X0A\x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm yellow and focally hemorrhagic region.  There is also a\X0D\\X0A\small amount of surrounding indurated white fibrous areas.  This area of\X0D\\X0A\induration extends to within less than 1 mm of the inked margins.  The entire\X0D\\X0A\area of concern, to include the surrounding inked resection margins, is\X0D\\X0A\submitted in blocks 2A through 2I.  The remaining specimen consists of soft\X0D\\X0A\yellow fat with a small amount of scattered fibrous tissue.  The remainder of\X0D\\X0A\the tissue, which is not situated at the area of concern, is submitted in blocks\X0D\\X0A\2J through 2M.  The entire specimen has been submitted.  The specimen is\X0D\\X0A\sectioned and placed in cassettes in formalin at 10:10 hours on **DATE[Jan 27 12].  \X0D\\X0A\3:  Received in formalin labeled ""right breast lumpectomy margins"" are two\X0D\\X0A\unoriented fragments of yellow red fibrofatty breast tissue, obtained from the\X0D\\X0A\patient at 15:35 and placed in formalin at 15:40 on **DATE[Jan 26 12].  Fragments measure\X0D\\X0A\2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.9 cm.  One of the surfaces on each fragment\X0D\\X0A\is more convex and yellow and presumed to represent the outermost margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\surface on each fragment will be inked in blue.  The opposite side of each\X0D\\X0A\fragment is more roughened, flat, and hemorrhagic, presumed to represent the\X0D\\X0A\margin nearest to the previous excision.  This surface will be inked in yellow. \X0D\\X0A\Each fragment is then serially sectioned and the cut surface consists of areas\X0D\\X0A\of firm, white fibrous tissue and soft and yellow adipose tissue.

This area is\X0D\\X0A\located in the inferior quadrant of the breast and is 1.3 cm from the\X0D\\X0A\superficial margin and 2.8 cm from the deep margin. There is a second firm mass\X0D\\X0A\identified in the central aspect of the breast with overall dimensions of 2.8 x\X0D\\X0A\2.8 x 2.5 cm. The secondary mass is approximately 3.5 cm away from the metal\X0D\\X0A\clip. The mass is 2.7 cm from the deep margin and 2 cm from the superficial\X0D\\X0A\margin. There appears to be an area of normal breast tissue between the biopsy\X0D\\X0A\site and the invasive mass.

Lobules are frequently filled and\X0D\\X0A\the neoplasm extends up the adjacent ducts. Scattered microcalcifications are\X0D\\X0A\seen. The invasive lobular carcinoma is noted focally and measures 7 mm x 4 mm x\X0D\\X0A\4 mm. The in situ component comprises approximately 90% of the neoplasm present\X0D\\X0A\and its size is difficult to estimate because of its presence in multiple tissue\X0D\\X0A\blocks and is estimated at between 15mm x 5mm x 5 mm.  There are extensive\X0D\\X0A\calcifications within the breast and these appear to be associated predominantly\X0D\\X0A\with two small tubular adenomatous proliferation one of which measures\X0D\\X0A\approximately 5mm x 5mm x 5 mm. Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within\X0D\\X0A\the breast tissue. Sections of the breast skin and nipple show no definite\X0D\\X0A\pagetoid intraepithelial spread and no involvement of the dermal lymphatics. \X0D\\X0A\Sections of the right sentinel lymph node which has been bisected shows mild\X0D\\X0A\sinus histiocytosis.

The infiltrating component of the\X0D\\X0A\tumor measures 22mm x 12mm x approximately 12 mm. There is no lymphvascular\X0D\\X0A\invasion identified. Lobular carcinoma in situ is extensively seen and\X0D\\X0A\approximates at least 60% of the tumor. The margins of excision are free of\X0D\\X0A\tumor; however, the deep margin is close and less than 1 mm (see block 3J).\X0D\\X0A\Calcifications are also abundantly noted throughout the sampled breast sections.\X0D\\X0A\Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within the breast tissue.

The\X0D\\X0A\procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis)\X0D\\X0A\by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The\X0D\\X0A\Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation\X0D\\X0A\performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are\X0D\\X0A\deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with\X0D\\X0A\appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2\X0D\\X0A\probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The\X0D\\X0A\slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe\X0D\\X0A\reactivity.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Analysis\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification\X0D\\X0A\is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent\X0D\\X0A\foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.  A ratio\X0D\\X0A\between 1.8-2.2 is considered equivocal amplification.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\References\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\1) Wolff A.C. et al.

The\X0D\\X0A\procedure in use has been modified from the FDA approved procedure (PathVysion from Vysis)\X0D\\X0A\by increasing the enzyme digestion to 20 minutes and using DAPI II as a counterstain.  The\X0D\\X0A\Flow Cytometry Laboratory takes responsibility for test performance, and the validation\X0D\\X0A\performed has proven extremely high between IHC and FISH.  Tissue sections are\X0D\\X0A\deparaffinized, pretreated and digested, then probed and incubated overnight, along with\X0D\\X0A\appropriate controls.  Two separate probes are used from Vysis:  a Spectrum Orange Her-2\X0D\\X0A\probe that is locus-specific and a Spectrum Green centromere probe for Chromosome 17.  The\X0D\\X0A\slides are counterstained with DAPI to produce an enhanced visualization of probe\X0D\\X0A\reactivity.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Analysis\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\The slides are viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The level of HER-2 gene amplification\X0D\\X0A\is measured as a ratio of orange (Her-2) fluorescent foci to green (CEP 17) fluorescent\X0D\\X0A\foci. A positive result is a ratio >2.2, and a negative result is a ratio <1.8.

The specimen is accompanied by a mammographic film and is found to contain a localization needle.  The film demonstrates a dense mass, fairly well-delineated lying adjacent to the midportion of the localization needle. The surgical margins are inked beginning with the superior lateral and proceeding in a clockwise fashion with red, green, orange and black.  The deep margin is inked with purple.  The breast tissue is found to contain a 1.2 cm. firm glistening white-tan mass.  Grossly the mass lies approximately 1 cm. or more from all margins except for the superior deep where it lies approximately 5 mm. or less from the inked surface.  The mass and this nearest margin are represented in Blocks A1 and 2.  The breast tissue shows evidence of blue dye discoloration consistent with tracer dye injection.

Microscopically this mass is composed of atypical epithelial cells forming an infiltrating pattern of tubules surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction.  The cells are mildly pleomorphic and the mitotic rate is low.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Grossly and microscopically, the neoplasm is noted to extend to within approximately 5 mm. of the superior deep margin.  The remaining margins are widely free of tumor by 1 cm. or more.   The additional superior deep margin submitted as Specimen C shows no evidence of carcinoma, therefore, all final margins are felt to be widely free of tumor. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the left axillary sentinel lymph node (Specimen B).  Staging criteria: T1c, N0 probable Stage IA.

In\X0D\\X0A\the center of this area, there is both an intraductal and infiltrating\X0D\\X0A\duct carcinoma present.  The intraductal component which makes up\X0D\\X0A\approximately 50% of the tumor shows very large duct structures\X0D\\X0A\distended by atypical epithelial cells in very complicated\X0D\\X0A\cribriform-type patterns with central areas of eosinophilic\X0D\\X0A\comedonecrosis.  The invasive portion of the tumor shows small fairly\X0D\\X0A\solid aggregates of epithelial cells with focal lumen formations but\X0D\\X0A\without well-formed tubular structures present.  These cells show small\X0D\\X0A\to moderate amounts of cytoplasm and contain nuclei which vary markedly\X0D\\X0A\from small and pyknotic up to giant vesicular nuclei with variably\X0D\\X0A\prominent nucleoli.  Occasional mitoses can be identified averaging 2\X0D\\X0A\per 10 high-power fields.

An immunoperoxidase stain for\X0D\\X0A\e-cadherin reveals marked cytoplasmic positivity of the invasive\X0D\\X0A\neoplastic cells indicative of ductal origin.  The uninvolved breast\X0D\\X0A\tissue shows a localized area of stromal fibrosis in association with\X0D\\X0A\focal papillomatosis and fairly extensive sclerosing adenosis with\X0D\\X0A\numerous luminal microcalcifications.

There is no orientation provided, such the\X0D\\X0A\aspect of the specimen would be larger, thus the fibrofatty tissue will\X0D\\X0A\be designated ""superior"".  The epidermal surface is pink-tan and smooth\X0D\\X0A\with no distinct biopsy sites, scars or lesions.  There is a 2 x 2 cm\X0D\\X0A\focus of reddish-purple bruising at the 7:00 to 8:00 o'clock position\X0D\\X0A\4.5 cm from the center of the nipple. There is an eccentric 3.8 cm in\X0D\\X0A\diameter areola with a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm everted nipple.  The posterior\X0D\\X0A\surface of the specimen is inked blue.  Sectioning the specimen reveals\X0D\\X0A\two distinct separate biopsy sites and a separate solid nodule.  The\X0D\\X0A\first biopsy site is located within the lower outer quadrant at\X0D\\X0A\approximately the 8:00-9:00 o'clock position and is 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.\X0D\\X0A\This first biopsy site is filled with clotted blood and pebble white\X0D\\X0A\biopsy seed material.  The first biopsy site is 2.0 cm from the nearest\X0D\\X0A\deep margin.  The first biopsy site is also approximately 1 cm deep to\X0D\\X0A\the overlying skin.  The second biopsy site is located within the upper\X0D\\X0A\outer quadrant 2.0 cm superior to the first biopsy site.  The second\X0D\\X0A\biopsy site is approximately 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and is located at the\X0D\\X0A\10:00 o'clock position.  The second biopsy site contains no biopsy seed\X0D\\X0A\material.  The second biopsy site is also 2.0 cm from the nearest deep\X0D\\X0A\margin and 1.0 cm from the overlying skin.  Directly lateral to the\X0D\\X0A\second biopsy site within the upper outer quadrant, there is a 0.6 x 0.5\X0D\\X0A\x 0.5 cm solid white-tan nodule.  The nodule is also located at the\X0D\\X0A\10:00 o'clock position and is 1.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\nodule has a solid white-tan cut surface.  There is a moderate amount of\X0D\\X0A\intervening slightly granular dense white fibrous tissue between the\X0D\\X0A\solid nodule and the two biopsy sites.  There are no other distinct\X0D\\X0A\lesions identified.  There is a single 0.5 cm possible pink-tan lymph\X0D\\X0A\node identified within the lateral breast tissue.  The remainder of the\X0D\\X0A\specimen is predominantly composed of dense white-tan fibrous tissue.\X0D\\X0A\There are occasional small cystic structures seen.

Comment:  The marrow shows numerous CD20-positive, non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregates composed predominantly of small round lymphocytes.  

The flow cytometric analysis shows a surface kappa light chain restricted B-cell population compatible with a CD5-negative, CD10-negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

Rare antigenic variants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma cannot be excluded by this study alone.

POPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-NEGATIVE PLASMA CELLS

COMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation shows an abnormal CD45-negative plasma cell population (larger in size by light scatter; 74% of all cells) which expresses CD38 and CD56, with a kappa clonal excess (dim intensity).  There is no significant expression for B-cell markers CD19, CD20, or CD22.  The immunophenotype is similar to a previous bone marrow specimen (***PATH-NUMBER[1]), and shows a clonal population of plasma cells.

Lymphocytes (3% of all cells) show a predominance of T-cells with no T-aberrancy (inverted CD4:CD8 ratio = 0.2).  B-lymphocytes (2% of lymphocytes) show no evidence of monoclonality.

Peripheral blood smear:  
Shows an estimated WBC count of 2-4,000, with a 100 cell differential revealing 25 segs, 5 bands, 2 metas, 1  myelo, 1 pro, 27 blasts, 26 lymphs, and 3 monos.  Some of the blasts contain azurophilic granules, but no Auer rods are seen.  The RBCs are unremarkable.  Platelets are slightly decreased.

Bone marrow aspirate smear and touch prep:
Shows poorly-spread, poorly-stained cellular particles, with scattered megakaryocytes, including apparent atypical forms.  Due to the poor quality of the smears, a differential count could not performed.  However, scanning the slides reveals numerous blasts which appear to comprise about half of the total nucleated population.  A few maturing granulocytic and erythrocytic precursors are present.  Due to the poor quality of preparation, dyspoiesis is difficult to assess. There is no evidence of opportunistic microorganisms, granulomata, or metastatic tumor.

Bone marrow biopsy and clot section:  
Sections reveal a bone marrow biopsy that is adequate for evaluation.  Both clot and biopsy show an estimated cellularity of 70-80%, with adequate numbers of megakaryocytes.  A heterogeneous population of granulocytic and erythrocytic precursors is present, with no focal accumulation of blasts.  The bony trabeculae are thin.  There is no evidence of opportunistic microorganisms, granulomata, or metastatic tumor.

POPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-DIM IMMATURE MONONUCLEAR POPULATION

COMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation shows a CD45-dim immature mononuclear population (moderate in size by light scatter; 77% of mononuclear cells) which expresses myeloid antigens, CD13 (partial), CD33, CD117, and myeloperoxidase and the progenitor cell antigen, CD34, as well as CD11b (partial, mostly negative), CD15, CD38, CD64 (partial, mostly negative), CD71 and HLA-DR.  In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T cell marker CD4, B cell marker CD19, and TdT (partial).  There no significant expression for other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T- or B-lineage differentiation.  

Peripheral blood shows that 49% of all cells are myeloblasts expressing CD34, CD117 and CD19. 

In summary, the described immunophenotypic findings are consistent with a blast population of myeloid lineage with aberrant coexpression of CD19 and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

These findings support the diagnosis of a serous carcinoma.  While primary serous carcinomas of the cervix do occur, the staining pattern present, as well as the lack of any fragments showing direct involvement of cervical tissue, are more suggestive of an endometrial primary.

-WILD TYPE FOR FLT3 D835 AND I836 MUTATIONS (NEGATIVE FOR D835 AND I836). 

RESULTS COMMENTS

DNA was isolated and analyzed for the presence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the ""juxtamembrane domain-coding region"" and mutations at the D835 and I836 codons in exon 20 in the FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) gene using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion    

This patient is positive and heterozygous for an internal tandem duplication but negative for mutations in codons 835 and 836. The presence of this mutation has been recognized as an independent poor prognostic factor in AML.  The presence of this mutation has been recognized as an independent poor prognostic factor in AML.  Genetics counseling is recommended.  

The sensitivity of this assay for detecting a FLT3 mutation in the background of a normal population, using these primers sets, is 1 in 100 cells.

METHODS:  MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from block F5.

Controls were appropriately positive for each immunohistochemical stain.  Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.

POPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-DIM IMMATURE MONONUCLEAR POPULATION

COMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation shows a CD45 (dim intensity) myeloblast population (smaller in size by light scatter, 32% of all cells) which expresses expresses myeloid antigens, CD13, CD33, CD117, and myeloperoxidase and the progenitor cell antigen, CD34 (partial), as CD38, C71 (dim, partial) and HLA-DR.  In addition, there is dim, partial expression for T cell marker, CD7 and no significant expression for TdT or other surface or cytoplasmic antigens associated with T- or B-lineage differentiation.  

There is also a CD45 (moderate intensity) abnormal monocyte population (moderate in size by light scatter; with higher side scatter characteristics, 56% of all cells) which expresses CD4 (dim), CD11b (strong), CD13 (strong), CD14 (My4, partial), CD15 (moderate), CD16 (partial), CD33, CD36 (dim-moderate), CD38, CD56 (dim, partial), CD64 (moderate), and myeloperoxidase.  There is no significant expression for CD7, CD14 (Mo2), CD34, and CD117.  

The overall findings are interpreted as showing a CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic features.

KRAS Mutation Analysis

Genotype Results:  
Wild-type (No mutation identified)

Reference RangeMutation Detected:
Unlikely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy.Mutation Not Detected:
May respond to anti-EGFR therapy.
Comment:  No KRAS mutations were detected by PCR.  Activating mutations in BRAF (V600E), a downstream effector in the KRAS pathway, have also been described to identify patients who are unlikely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy (D. Nicolantonio et al., J Clin Oncol **DATE[Feb 10 2009]).  Additional BRAF mutational analysis can be performed, if clinically indicated (please call  **PHONE to order this test).

Methodology:  Tumor areas were identified, selectively microdissected and lysed, and DNA extracted.  Real-time PCR using eight primer sets was used to amplify the region of the KRAS gene containing codons 12 and 13.  A set of eight probes was used to specifically detect the wild-type and mutant sequences.

Intended Use:  The KRAS mutation analysis by real-time PCR detects the wild-type sequence and seven known mutations associated with codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS oncogene.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation to 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  Tumors harboring a KRAS mutation show relative insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase receptor therapies that signal through the RAS/RAF pathway.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management

Prognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or histopathological findings.

This assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by **INSTITUTION.  Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA  88, this laboratory has established the test s accuracy and precision.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as the FDA has determined that such approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

Skin, right anterior thigh, punch biopsy (**PLACE, HI, ***PATH-NUMBER[1], **DATE[Feb 14 2012]):

The following results were performed at **INSTITUTION Department of Pathology and reported by 
**NAME[ZZZ YYY], M.D. on **DATE[Mar 13 2012].  The results were discussed with **NAME[EEE WWW] on **DATE[Mar 19 12] at 10:15 a.m.


Note:  We agree that the histologic appearance of the dermal infiltrate is highly suggestive of cutaneous involvement by classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL).  However, there are a number of features that prevent us from making a definitive diagnosis.  Both the site and the clinical history are extremely unusual for CHL, but the major impediment to establishing a definitive diagnosis is that the immunophenotype is also not completely characteristic.  All of the large cells show strong CD20 and PAX5-positivity, as well as some CD45 positivity.  CD30 staining is positive but somewhat weak for CHL, and CD15 is almost completely negative.

This is an extremely challenging case.  Since there are multiple infectious/inflammatory processes that can mimic many features of CHL, in the absence of a classic immunophenotype and in conjunction with the unusual site and clinical presentation, we are unable to make a definitive diagnosis of CHL.  There are numerous small background T-cells, as well as numerous variably-sized B-cells, but, in our opinion, the atypical lymphoid infiltrate does not meet the criteria for peripheral T-cell lymphoma or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma either.  Antigen receptor PCR analyses for B-cell and T-cell clonality were performed in consideration of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and both were negative.  The case was reviewed at the **NAME[DDD FFF] Conference on **DATE[Mar 5 2012] by Drs. **NAME[VVV, UUU, TTT] and **NAME[SSS]: they concur with this interpretation.

Microscopic Description:  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the skin punch biopsy show skin with a superficial to deep dense lymphocytic infiltrate restricted to the dermis and not involving the overlying epidermis.  Scattered large atypical cells with prominent nucleoli and cytoplasmic clearing/retraction resembling classical Hodgkin lymphoma lacunar cells are present.  The background infiltrate is composed of numerous small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells.

Immunohistochemical Stains:  The following immunostains were received for review from the referring institution:  CD3, CD5, CD10, CD15, CD20, CD21, CD30, CD45, BCL2, BCL6, PAX 5 and EMA.  Limited additional immunostaining were performed at OHSU, using the CD3, CD15, CD20, CD30 and PAX 5 antibodies, which showed similar staining to the outside immunostains.  The large atypical cells show the following immunophenotype:
  CD3  negative
  CD5  negative
  CD10  negative
  CD15  rare positive cells
  CD20  strongly and homogenously positive
  CD30  variably positive
  CD45  variably positive
  BCL2  negative
  BCL6  occasional positive cell
  PAX 5  strongly positive

The background small lymphocytes are mainly CD3 and CD5-positive T-cells, but there are also numerous, variably-sized B-cells in the infiltrate, highlighted by staining with the CD20 and PAX 5 antibodies.

In Situ Hybridization:  Molecular probes were used in an in situ hybridization analysis for **NAME[RRR QQQ] virus encoded mRNA.  Appropriate controls, including RNA controls, were performed and test validity confirmed.  The large atypical cells are negative for Epstein-Barr virus on the in situ hybridization analysis.

(Analyte specific reagents are used in many laboratory tests necessary for standard medical care and generally do not require FDA approval.  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OHSU laboratories.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)./r/n"

POPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-BRIGHT LYMPHOID POPULATION

COMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation of the CD45-bright lymphoid population shows a predominance of T-lymphocytes with both CD4 and CD8 subsets (CD4:CD8 ratio=0.77), limited panel.  There is no obvious evidence of B-monoclonality.  CD3-/CD56+ natural killer cells comprise 19% of the lymphocytes.

The flow cytometry study demonstrates a clonal plasma cell population.  If indicated, please correlate with serum M-protein levels and examine for any myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment (i.e., hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions) to aid with the proper plasma cell neoplasm classification.

Of note, the yield of plasma cells by flow cytometry is typically underestimated;1 and, thus, the total percentage of plasma cells should be determined via the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.  Please also see the concurrent bone marrow biopsy (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).

  4.  Lymphocytes comprise 4-5% of the total cells and include mixed T, NK, NK/T, and polytypic B 
    cells without aberrant antigen co-expression or loss.
DiagnosisComment:
There are three abnormal populations detected in this bone marrow specimen.  The majority blast population (#1) comprises 32-80% of the total cells and has an immunophenotype consistent with a B lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma.  The remaining two populations (#2 and #3) are fewer in number (2% and 4% of the total cells, respectively) and have mixed immunophenotypic characteristics of myeloid cells and B cells.  (Population #2 co-expresses myeloperoxidase and cytoplasmic mu heavy chain.  Population #3 co-expresses myeloperoxidase, cytoplasmic mu heavy chain, and dim surface CD19.)

Collectively, the flow cytometric findings may represent 1) a B lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma with concurrent immature, aberrant myeloid blast populations or 2) an ""acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage,"" as defined by the 2008 World Health Organization.  If indicated, consider correlation with cytogenetics to possibly aid in classification for an acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage [i.e., mixed phenotype acute leukemia with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2); mixed phenotype acute leukemia with t(v;11q23); mixed phenotype acute leukemia, B/myeloid, NOS).

The findings are similar to the previous flow cytometric analysis of the peripheral blood (***PATH-NUMBER[2]).

Peripheral Blood:  CBC performed on **DATE[Aug 10 2012] shows a WBC count of 12.6 K/mm3.  The differential shows 18% segs, 43% lymphocytes, 3% atypical lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 1% metamyelocytes, and 31% blasts.  The RBC count is 4.41 M/mm3, hemoglobin 13.3 gm/dl, hematocrit 38.1%, MCV 86.4 fl, MCH 30.3 pg, MCHC 35.0 gm/dl, and platelet count 129 K/mm3.  The peripheral blood smear reveals normochromic, normocytic erythrocytes with unremarkable morphology.  No rouleau formation is seen.  Leukocytes and blasts are present in a distribution corresponding to the reported differential.  Platelets appear numerically decreased and morphologically unremarkable.  

Bone Marrow:  The aspirate smears show well-stained particles with adequate megakaryocytes.  Hematopoiesis is minimal.  The cells largely consist of blasts.  The morphology of the blast cells ranges from small, round blasts with dispersed chromatin and scanty cytoplasm, typical of L1 lymphoblasts, to larger blasts with oval to irregular hyperchromatic nuclei, and scanty deeply basophilic cytoplasm with cytoplasmic blebbing.  Single nucleoli are present in some of these larger blasts.  The core biopsy and clot section show an average cellularity of 100%.  Scattered megakaryocytes are present.  The bone marrow biopsy and clot sections are largely replaced with sheets of small blasts with round nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasm.  No extrinsic cells or granulomas are seen.

POPULATION REPORTED:  ENTIRE LYMPHOID POPULATION

COMMENT:  Flow cytometric evaluation of the lymphoid population shows a predominance of immunophenotypically normal T-lymphocytes with both CD4 and CD8 subsets (CD4:CD8 ratio=4.2), without loss of pan-T-cells antigens.  There is also a minute abnormal T-lymphoid population (smaller in size by light scatter; 5% of all cells) which expresses CD4, CD5, and CD7 with no significant expression of CD3, CD8 or natural killer cell markers (CD3-16+, or CD3-56+).  The significance of this immunophenotypic finding is uncertain.

D. Lymph node, left inferior pulmonary ligament region: One lymph node with no definite evidence of metastatic melanoma (see comment)./r/nDiagnosisComment:
Immunohistochemical staining for Melan A (with Giemsa counterstain) as well as melanin bleach and iron special stains, are performed on sections from blocks A5, A10, and B2. All controls react appropriately.  The lung tumor is largely necrotic with peripheral rims of intact Melan-A-positive melanoma cells, which lose their pigment with the melanin bleach stain.  Scattered iron-positive histiocytes are also present.  Lymph nodes demonstrate anthracotic pigmentation and have reactive features which include abundant sinusoidal histiocytes with bland cytologic features. Many of the histiocytes contain melanin pigments, likely acquired draining the necrotic melanotic tumor in the lung. No unequivocal melanoma cells (e.g. pigmented cells with cytologic atypia consistent with metastatic tumor) are identified in any of the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes also contain scattered histiocytes with iron pigments.

B: Gastric biopsy mass, lesser curvature
C: Gastric biopsy mass, cardia lesser curvature",,"AddendumComment:
This Addendum is created to incorporate additional immunohistochemical staining results for part C.

For Part C (cardia lesser curvature), additional immunohistochemical stains were conducted in an attempt to further characterize the neoplasm.  Unfortunately, the small amount of neoplastic cells in the original hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections does not appear in the deeper, immunohistochemically stained tissue sections (conducted for this Addendum), thereby precluding further characterization.  

The morphologic features and the prior immunohistochemical stains (i.e., CD56 and synaptophysin) suggest a poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, favoring small cell carcinoma.  However, in the absence of a full immunohistochemical work-up, other malignancies (i.e., atypical forms of hematopoietic neoplasms, gastrointestinal stromal tumor) cannot be definitively excluded.

If indicated, consider submission of more tissue/sampling of tumor to aid the diagnosis.  


Addendum Microscopic Description
For Part C, additional immunohistochemical staining was conducted to further characterize the neoplasm.  PAX-5, CD20, CD34, CD99 (MIC 2), CD117, TdT, S100, and Ki-67 (positive controls intact) were conducted.  However, no neoplastic cells are present for staining in the deeper tissue sections."

DiagnosisComment:
In part B, the tumor is present from the lower uterine segment/endocervix myometrium extending to the endocervical canal.  The tumor is present at the posterior supracervical margin of excision.  

In part C, there is transmural extension of the tumor.  The tumor extends to the distal margin.  Lymphovascular space invasion by tumor is present. 

Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin 7 and estrogen receptor.  The tumor is negative for cytokeratin 20, CDX2, WT-1, Oscar, LCA and p63.  The cytokeratin 7+/ cytokeratin 20- phenotype is seen in tumors of the gynecologic tract and are not consistent with a gastrointestinal primary.  The ER positivity lends further support for a gynecologic primary.  The tumor does not appear to be arising from the endometrium or the ovaries and is predominately located within the cervical/endocervical region.  Additional immunohistochemical stains to further classify this tumor are pending and will be reported separately.

POPULATION REPORTED:  CD45-BRIGHT LYMPHOID POPULATION

COMMENT:  By flow cytometric analysis, approximately 20% of cells in the specimen display the phenotypic and light scatter properties of lymphocytes.  Most of these are T cells, without obvious phenotypic abnormality, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets (CD4/CD8 ratio of 1.0).  There is a relatively distinct population of B cells, which are phenotypically immature, with a composite immunophenotype consistent with that seen in normal B-cell precursors (hematogones; 4% of all cells).  Phenotypically mature B cells comprise approximately 26% of lymphocytes and show a mixture of kappa- and lambda-bearing cells, without evidence of light chain restriction.  Cells with bright CD38 expression, dim CD45 expression, and light scatter properties characteristic of plasma cells comprise 1% of all cells, and include a mixture of cytoplasmic kappa- and lambda-bearing cells.  No distinct light chain-restricted plasma cell population is detectable.  

CD34+ myeloblasts comprise 2% of all cells in the specimen and express myeloid antigens, CD13 and CD33 as well as HLA-DR and CD38.  A subset of the cells with immunophenotypic and light scatter characteristics of monocytes shows weak aberrant expression for CD56.  A subset of the granulocytes also shows weak CD56 expression.  The aberrant expression of CD56 by the maturing myelomonocytic cells may be seen in conditions which include reactive/regenerative marrow, myelodysplasia and after chemotherapy and/or cytokine treatment.  Granulocytes show a normal pattern of phenotypic maturation with respect to CD11b, CD13 and CD16.

METHODS:  MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from block A9.

Controls were appropriately positive for each immunohistochemical stain.  Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.
ResultsComments:
Based on the four-antibody panel, there is no immunohistochemical evidence to suggest a mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite unstable carcinoma."

  1.   Sample viability is suboptimal (84%), which may result in non-random cell loss, antigen       deterioration, and/or non-specific staining.

  2.  Surface lambda light chain-restricted, CD5-positive, CD10-partial positive B cell population,       comprising 66% of the total cells (see Comment).  The cells are small to large in size by forward 
    angle light scatter and have low to intermediate internal complexity by side angle light scatter.

BREAST CANCER PROGNOSTIC PANEL:  
***PATH-NUMBER[1], BLOCK # A7 (INVASIVE CARCINOMA)

            ESTROGEN RECEPTOR:                   90%
            PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR:            83%

COMMENT:
ERPR     
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical methods on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer 
  using antibodies against ER (SP1 IVD), PR (clone IE2 IVD).  Though the largest studies have used 10% as a 
  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. 

HER-2/neu
  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu 
  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and 
  equivocal) were appropriate.

  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following 
  manner, as determined by in-house studies:

  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP 
  Result:          Score:

  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)

  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in 
                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the 
                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive 
                       tumor cells)

  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% 
                       invasive tumor cells)

  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise 
  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[May 2003], **PLACE, 
  IL).

  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American 
  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 
  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

B.  Received in formalin labeled ""left breast tissue suture marks at axillary tail"" is a mastectomy specimen with attached tan-white skin ellipse having overall dimensions of 22.5 x 15.0 x 7.5 cm.  The attached skin ellipse measures 10.1 x 4.0 cm.  In the medial aspect of the ellipse is an intact tan-brown nipple and areola measuring 4.3 x 3.0 cm.  In the inferior portion of the specimen there is a previously blue inked area.  The deep margin is inked red.  Sectioning reveals a tan-yellow to white fibrofatty cut surface.  In the superior medial aspect of the specimen is a poorly circumscribed tan-white, firm stellate nodule measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm.  The cut surface is tan-white with multiple hemorrhagic areas grossly consistent with previous biopsy.  The lesion is located 1.0 cm from the deep margin.

A.  Sections of lymph node exhibit mild reactive hyperplasia.  There is no metastasis on routine stain.  Immunostain evaluation deferred due to additional nodes present in part B.

B.  Sections of breast demonstrate an invasive, moderately-differentiated ductal carcinoma with prominent adjacent duct carcinoma in-situ of intermediate nuclear grade.  Margins of the mastectomy are free of tumor involvement.  Within the axillary portion, an additional 7 nodes are present, exhibiting areas of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis, however, all nodes are negative for metastasis.","A: Sentinel node biopsy, left axillary tail

INTERPRETATION:
***PATH-NUMBER[1] (INVASIVE CARCINOMA)

ESTROGEN RECEPTOR:      99%
PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR:    97%
HER-2/neu    (ACIS score)       1.6          (REFLEXED TO SISH TESTING)

COMMENT:
ERPR:  
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on   formalin-  fixed paraffin-embedded section stained by immunohistochemical methods on the Ventana Benchmark XT 
  automated stainer using antibodies against ER (SP1 IVD) and PR (clone IE2 IVD).  Though the largest 
  studies have used 10% as a threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%.

HER-2/neu:
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on   formalin-  fixed paraffin-embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and equivocal) were appropriate.

The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following manner, as determined by in-house studies:

ChromaVision       ASCO/CAP
Result:          Score:

Less than 1.5      0
(No staining)

Less than 1.5      1+
(Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

1.5 to 3.4      2+
(Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than or equal to 30% of invasive tumor cell)

Greater than 3.4      3+
(Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive tumor cells)

A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I meeting, **DATE[Feb 2003], **PLACE, IL).

Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu 
  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and 
  equivocal) were appropriate.

  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following 
  manner, as determined by in-house studies:

  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP 
  Result:          Score:

  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)

  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in 
                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the 
                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive 
                       tumor cells)

  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% 
                       invasive tumor cells)

  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise 
  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[May 2003], **PLACE, 
  IL).

  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American 
  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 
  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

Average number of CHROMOSOME 17 centromeres/nucleus is 2.

The SISH (silver in situ hybridization) HER2 assay is performed at **PLACE, Nevada Business Unit.  The SISH assay uses the Ventana Benchmark automated stainer and Ventana INFORM HER2 and chromosome 17 (Chr17) probes on formalin?fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.  Results are scored by a pathologist as follows:  negative for amplification (HER2:Chr17 less than 1.8), equivocal for amplification (1.8 greater than or equal to HER2:Chr17 less than or equal to 2.2), and positive for amplification (HER2:Chr17 greater than 2.2).  Controls stain appropriately.  This test fulfills the ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2 testing that mandate that a new test should demonstrate a high (greater than or equal to 95%) concordance with another validated test (i.e. FISH) for positive (amplified) and negative (nonamplified) results.

(A)  Received in formalin labeled ""right axillary contents"" is a yellow-red and soft fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 10 x 5.7 x 2.1 cm.  At least ten possible lymph nodes are noted.  The largest measures 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  The lymph nodes are submitted as whole in cassettes A1 - A6.  

(B)  Received fresh labeled ""right breast cancer"" is an oriented breast mass excision specimen measuring 7.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is oriented with metallic margin markers, and is inked as follows:  cranial - blue, lateral - violet, medial - red, deep - black, caudal - green and skin - orange.  There is an anteriorly inserted localization wire that terminates within the caudal medial aspect of the specimen.  The guide wire tip shows breast tissue that is yellow and fatty.  No suspicious lesions or nodules surrounding the hook wire.  Within the middle aspect of the specimen on the anterior and lateral portion is a tan-white and firm gritty nodule (possible biopsy site) that measures 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  It is within 0.3 cm under the violet inked lateral margin.  About 1.5 cm medially and anteriorly of the nodule is a 0.4 cm tan-white and firm nodule that appears to be grossly consistent with tumor.  It is within 0.8 cm of the nearest orange inked anterior surface, 1.5 cm from the violet inked lateral margin and more than 2 cm from the remaining margins.  Some areas surrounding the suspicious lesion are tan-pink and rubbery, suggestive of fibrocystic change.  All remaining breast tissue is yellow and fatty.  All margins appear grossly clear of the nodule.  Representative sections are submitted sequentially from caudal to cranial in fourteen cassettes.  Sections suspicious for cancer are submitted in cassettes B4 and B5.  

Also received is a yellow-pink and soft fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm.  The specimen is inked black.  All sections are yellow and fatty with some areas of hemorrhage.  No gross lesions or suspicious nodules noted.  Random sections of separate fatty tissue fragment in cassettes B13 and B14.

Received fresh labeled ""**NAME[BBB], right breast"" is a mastectomy which measures 13.3 x 12.6 x 4.0 cm.  The anterior surface is covered by an 11.3 x 3.9 cm skin ellipse centrally occupied by a nipple and areola which measures 2.7 cm in diameter.  The specimen is oriented, the margins are inked.  The specimen is serially sectioned (""bread-loafed"") at 1.0 cm intervals revealing a white, partially calcified, firm region which measures 2.4 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm.  The edge of this region comes to within 0.2 cm of the closest adjacent resected specimen margin, which is the posterior margin (black).  The distances of this region to the margins are as follows:
Medial-orange-9.2 cm; Lateral-yellow-1.6 cm; Posterior-black-0.2 cm; Superior-blue-8.3 cm; Inferior-green-2.6 cm; Skin-no color- 2.4 cm.

Sectioning through the remainder of the specimen shows a rubbery, white, fibrotic area, up to 5.1 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm, 0.7 cm from the closest adjacent resected specimen margin, which is the inferior (green) margin.  This white area is in the 6 to 9 o clock position, 0.8 cm from the nipple.  There are areas of hemorrhage which appear to be previous core biopsy site.

The above diagnosis and following results are performed at **PLACE, NV, and reported by **NAME[YYY M. XXX], M.D., on **DATE[Nov 9 12].

ERPR:  
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on   formalin-  fixed paraffin-embedded section stained by immunohistochemical methods on the Ventana Benchmark XT 
  automated stainer using antibodies against ER (SP1 IVD) and PR (clone IE2 IVD).  Though the largest 
studies have used 10% as a threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%.

HER-2/neu:
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on   formalin-  fixed paraffin-embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and equivocal) were appropriate.

The results obtained from the Chromavision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following manner, as determined by in-house studies:

Chromavision       ASCO/CAP
Result:          Score:

Less than 1.5      0
(No staining)

Less than 1.5      1+
(Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

1.5 to 3.4      2+
(Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than or equal to 30% of invasive tumor cell)

Greater than 3.4      3+
(Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive tumor cells)

A Chromavision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I meeting, **DATE[May 2003], **PLACE, IL).

Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

DiagnosisComment:
Immunostains for keratin, p63, and HC-myosin were performed to evaluate the area of possible invasion.  Although the area measures less than 0.5 mm in size, there appears to be true early stromal invasion.  In addition, the tumor cells show some p63 positivity which suggests a ""basal"" immunophenotype.  There is insufficient invasive tumor to perform prognostic marker testing.

L1 bone lesion:  Metastatic carcinoma consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma (see comment)./r/nDiagnosisComment:
The H\T\E-stained sections of the bone biopsy show that most of the marrow space is overrun by a desmoplastic stromal reaction with associated reactive bone formation.  Within the desmoplastic stroma are scattered round to oval cells which stain positively with both cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (establishing an epithelial origin) and estrogen receptor (ER).  The findings are consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma.  The immunohistochemical stains were performed on sections of the decalcified, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded bone biopsy; all controls react appropriately.  Of note, the small amount of residual background marrow that is present demonstrates trilineage hematopoiesis.

            ESTROGEN RECEPTOR:                   91%

COMMENT:
ERPR     
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical methods on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer 
  using antibodies against ER (SP1 IVD), PR (clone IE2 IVD).  Though the largest studies have used 10% as a 
  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. 

HER-2/neu
  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu 
  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and 
  equivocal) were appropriate.

  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following 
  manner, as determined by in-house studies:

  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP 
  Result:          Score:

  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)

  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in 
                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the 
                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive 
                       tumor cells)

  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% 
                       invasive tumor cells)

  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise 
  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[Mar 2003], **PLACE, 
  IL).

  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American 
  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 
  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

Specimen signed out at **STREET-ADDRESS, **ROOM, **PLACE, HI   **ZIP-CODE.",,"GrossDescription:
Received in formalin, labeled ""XXXXXX, left breast"" is a breast with attached axillary tissue, measuring up to 26.0 x 16.0 x 3.8 cm.  The axillary contents measure up to 8.5 x 7.5 x 3.3 cm.  The overlying, attached segment of skin measures up to 13.0 cm in length and 7.5 cm in width.  The nipple and areola measure 1.2 and 2.2 cm in diameter, respectively, and are unremarkable.  Present approximately 1.5 cm superior to the nipple, and extending along the upper outer and upper inner quadrant is a sutured, roughly linear incision measuring up to 4.5 cm in length.  The specimen is inked as follows: superior anterior - orange, inferior anterior - blue, posterior (deep) - black.  Deep to the incision, sectioning reveals a biopsy cavity that measures up to 5.7 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm.  The biopsy cavity is located approximately 1.0 cm from the skin surface and extends to within 0.3 cm of the posterior (deep) margin and measures up to 5.7 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm.  A biopsy cavity is lined by slightly firm, tan to pink-tan tissue.  No definite residual tissue is grossly identified.  Elsewhere, sections through the remainder of the breast reveals lobulated fatty tissue, and scant amounts of rubbery breast parenchyma.  The axillary tissue is arbitrarily divided into thirds, designated as ""lower, mid, and upper"".  Embedded within the soft tissue are multiple non-matted lymph nodes, ranging from a few millimeters up to 2.0 cm.  The cut surfaces are pink-gray to gray-white, rubbery to slightly firm.  The specimen is placed in formalin on **DATE[Mar 28 12] at 12:30pm for a total fixation time of approximately 6.5 hours.  Cold ischemic time information was not provided.  Representative sections and all identified lymph nodes are submitted.

A.  Left breast lumpectomy:  Received is a breast biopsy that is covered by an ellipse of skin measuring up to 7 x 4 cm.  The skin is tan without gross evidence of Pagetoid changes.  The underlying specimen measures 9 x 8 x 2.5 cm.  On section, a well-defined yellow-white firm nodule with sharp borders measures up to 1 cm in dimension.  This is submitted in cassettes A1 and A2.  A second centrally located area of increased stromal fibrosis is noted.  Well-defined margins are not appreciated in this specimen.  This is nearly entirely submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.  On sectioning, this second area contains palpable small 0.3 cm areas of firmness.  The surgical margins are grossly widely free from both nodules.
 
B.  Right lateral thigh lesion:  An elliptical biopsy of skin measuring up to 1.3 x 1 x 0.3 cm surrounds a central ulceration.  The center is submitted in cassette B1 and the tails are submitted in cassette B2.","MicroscopicDescription:
A.  Left breast lumpectomy:  The well-defined lesion that is submitted in cassettes A1 and A2 demonstrate a mixture of large very atypical cells intermixed with acute and chronic inflammatory cells with a few xanthomatous-like cells.  The nuclei of some of these cells are up to 5 to 7 times the diameter of a poly.  Chromatin is coarse with occasional single to multiple eosinophilic nucleoli.  Pigmentation is not appreciated.  The palpable smaller nodules within the fibrous stroma that are submitted in cassettes B1 and B2 contain similar nodules of atypical cells.   Atypical cells are negative for melanA, HMB45, S100, cytokeratin A1/A3, cytokeratin 8/18, LCA, vimentin, desmin, and CD30.  Atypical cells are positive for CD31 and are questionably positive for collagen IV.  The histology is similar to that seen in the prior biopsy ***PATH-NUMBER[1].
 
B.  Right lateral thigh lesion:  The epidermis is ulcerated by a tumor composed of solid and cystic irregular nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading.  Neither vascular nor neural invasion is noted.  The surgical margins are free of tumor.","A: Left breast lumpectomy

COMMENT:
ERPR     
  Analysis is performed using ChromaVision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical methods on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer 
  using antibodies against ER (SP1 IVD), PR (clone IE2 IVD).  Though the largest studies have used 10% as a 
  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. 

HER-2/neu
  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-
  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu 
  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.

  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and 
  equivocal) were appropriate.

  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following 
  manner, as determined by in-house studies:

  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP 
  Result:          Score:

  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)

  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)

  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in 
                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the 
                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive 
                       tumor cells)

  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% 
                       invasive tumor cells)

  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise 
  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[Jan 2003], **PLACE, 
  IL).

  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American 
  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than 
  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.

COMMENT:  The infiltrating lobular carcinoma in this specimen appears to be spreading more widely than the 4.8 cm mass palpated grossly upon dissection of this excisional specimen. It appears to spread within and along neurovascular septa greater than the 5cm size for a T3 category. The sampling in part C shows a few  ""indian-file"" cells on the frozen amidst  stromal fibrosis that remain suspicious for tumor after the permanent H&E and IHC for keratin stains are reviewed. Multiple intramammary foci of infiltrating and in situ lobular carcinoma are found on the slides in areas not identified grossly. The tumor is close to multiple inked margins as detailed above. These findings were discussed with Dr. **NAME[XXX] on **DATE[Feb 22 12].",,"GrossDescription:
Specimen A:  Received in formalin, labeled ""SN #1 460 hot not blue"" is an irregular piece of rubbery tan-yellow tissue (1.7 x 1.2 x 1 cm).  The specimen is bisected to reveal a single node.  The entire specimen is submitted in A.

Specimen B:  Received in formalin, labeled ""#2 sentinel node 1900 hot not blue"" is an irregular piece of rubbery tan-yellow tissue (2.8 x 2 x 1.2 cm).  The specimen is bisected to reveal a single node.  The entire specimen is submitted in B.

Specimen C:  Received in the fresh state, labeled ""breast nodule frozen"" is an irregular piece of rubbery pink-tan tissue (0.7 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm).  The specimen is submitted for a frozen section and then entirely submitted in cassette C.

Specimen D:  Received in formalin, labeled ""L breast mass, skin-anterior, short-superior, long-lateral, long/short-medial"" is a lumpectomy specimen consisting of an ellipse of tan skin (3.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm) and attached tan-yellow tissue (8.3 cm superior to inferior by 6.7 cm lateral to medial by 3.8 cm anterior to posterior).  The skin designates the anterior margin, a short suture marks the superior margin, a long suture marks the lateral margin and one short and one long suture marks the medial margin.  Surgical margins are differentially inked as follows: superior-blue ink, inferior-yellow ink, anterior-black ink, posterior-green ink, lateral and medial-red ink.  The specimen is serially sectioned into fourteen lamellae from lateral (lamella 1) to medial (lamella 14) direction.  Lamellae 1 through 10 grossly reveal a firm, pink-tan mass (4.8 x 2.4 x 2.1 cm).  The mass grossly approaches 1.5 cm within the superior margin, 1.5 cm within the inferior margin, 0.2 cm within the anterior margin, 1 cm within the posterior margin, 0.5 cm within the lateral margin and 1.9 cm within the medial margin.  An apparent pink-tan to white fibrous area is found within the specimen near the superior aspect.  Grossly unable to determine whether the fibrous area is part of the mass, and therefore is not included in the gross measurement of the mass.  The remainder of the specimen consists of adipose tissue.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Received unfixed labeled ""right breast, **NAME[AAA] XXXXXX"" is an ovoid yellow-red piece of tissue that weighs 14.2 gm and measures 5.2 cm from medial to lateral x 3.6 cm from superior to inferior x 1.8 cm from anterior to deep.  There is a short suture at  the superior margin, a long suture at the lateral margin, and a double suture at the deep margin.  The specimen is differentially inked:  Orange ink marks the anterior margin, black ink the deep margin, green ink the superior margin, blue ink the inferior margin, red ink the medial margin, and yellow ink the lateral margin.  There is a localizing wire inserted into the medial aspect of the specimen that extends to the lateral breast.  The specimen was removed from the patient at 09:23 hours and placed in formalin at 0936 resulting in approximately 9 hours and 30 minutes of formalin fixation.  Sectioning the specimen reveals a firm pale appearing zone within the medial portion of the specimen that abuts the deep margin and measures 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm.  Proceeding laterally there is a focally hemorrhagic pale appearing zone within the mid portion of the specimen that also extends toward the deep margin and is not firm.  No discrete lesions are seen.  The specimen is submitted entirely in 12 cassettes as serial sections from medial to lateral.","MicroscopicDescription:

B. Colon biopsy, clinically ""transverse colon mass at 70 cm"":
  AT LEAST ADENOMATOUS POLYP WITH FOCAL SEVERE DYSPLASIA (SEE COMMENT)
DiagnosisComment:
The clinical history is noted of two large colon masses- one in the proximal ascending colon, and one in the transverse colon.  The small biopsies taken from the transverse colon mass show dysplasia with at least focal severe dysplasia.  It is noted that considering the highly suspicious clinical history and the small biopsy size, the likelihood of an unsampled invasive carcinoma is strongly considered.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Multiple deeper levels are examined.

Controls were appropriately positive for each immunohistochemical stain.  Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.

Received in formalin, labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a segment of large bowel (11.5 cm in length by 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter) with a suture marking the distal end of the specimen.  The proximal resection margin is left open and inked black.  The distal resection margin is stapled.  The staples are removed and the revised distal resection margin is inked red.  The mesenteric resection margin is inked green.  Serosa is smooth, tan-red.  The specimen is opened to reveal a rubbery to firm tan-red well circumscribed mass (3.5 x 3.3 x 2.5 cm).  The mass is found 6 cm away from the proximal resection margin, 2.5 cm away from the distal resection margin and 4 cm away from the mesenteric resection margin.

Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, and CDX2 are performed on sections from the left ovary (block A9, right ovary (block B9), sigmoid colon (block E4), and small bowel (block F2).  All controls react appropriately.  The tumor in each of these four locations stain uniformly positive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2, and all are negative for cytokeratin 7.  These findings support the diagnosis of a colonic primary with metastases to the ovaries and small bowel.

METHODS: MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from block A1.

Controls were appropriately positive for each immunohistochemical stain.  Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.
ResultsComments:
Loss of PMS2 protein expression is noted in the carcinoma and adenoma without evidence of MLH1 loss; however, since MLH1 is much more frequently implicated than PMS2 in DNA mismatch repair defects, a primary deficiency of MLH1 is still a strong consideration.  Correlation with additional molecular genetic testing, particularly PMS2 gene mutation analysis, may be helpful and further evaluation by a genetics counselor at the **INSTITUTION (phone: **PHONE) is highly recommended.

A.  Received fresh, previously opened and unoriented, labeled ""XXXXXX, **NAME[AAA], sigmoid colon"" is an unoriented segment of pink-tan, intestinal tissue measuring up to 13.5 cm in length x 9.0 cm in greatest circumference. There is a well-circumscribed, centrally ulcerated and necrotic tumor measuring 5.3 x 4.2 x 0.5 cm.  The tumor is approximately 2.7 cm away from one margin, which has been inked blue, and approximately 5.5 cm away from the opposite margin, which has been inked orange.  The mass is nearly circumferential.  The underlying fat and serosal surface is inked black beneath the tumor.  Sectioning of the tumor reveals that it penetrates through the muscularis propria and does extend to the serosa and fat.  There are two suspicious, shaggy-appearing areas at the blue margin.  Examination of the fat reveals multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.7 cm to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension.  

  KEY TO CASSETTES:
  A1    -  Orange shave margin
  A2    -  Blue shave margin and one perpendicular representative section of the margin

A.  Two separate tumors are identified.  The tumor in the cecum (tumor #1) has a prominent component of tubulovillous adenoma with areas of high grade dysplasia, and only focally invades into the submucosa (multiple H\T\E-stained step sections examined).  The second tumor focus (tumor #2) arises from a tubular adenoma in the ascending portion of the colon, and shows more extensive invasion into the muscularis propria.  The pathologic staging is thus based on tumor #2 (pT2 N0).

Comment: This case was reviewed in intradepartmental consensus conference. Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] was notified of the diagnosis per telephone conversation at 4:31 pm on **DATE[Oct 23 11].   There is no evidence of DNA mismatch repair deficiency in the carcinoma, indicating that the tumor is most likely microsatellite stable, and that Lynch syndrome (a common cause of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC) is very unlikely.  Lynch syndrome cannot be completely excluded because some germline mismatch repair gene mutations may rarely have intact expression of a non-functional mismatch repair protein. Additional testing (MSI and/or germline) should be considered if the patient meets high risk criteria for Lynch syndrome. If MSI testing is desired, please call Caris Life Sciences at **PHONE. In addition, about one half of HNPCC is caused by alterations in other unknown genes (so-called familial colorectal cancer type X), for which no testing is currently available.   DNA mismatch repair intact cancers, such as this example, are associated with decreased overall patient survival when compared to patients with mismatch repair deficient cancers. Studies also demonstrate that mismatch repair intact cancers are often sensitive to 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy, but typically resistant to irinotecan (CPT-11).

Specimen C.  Received in formalin, labeled ""perforated sigmoid colon"" is a segment of large bowel/sigmoid colon (16 cm in length by 3.5 cm in diameter) with metal clips marking the distal resection margin.  The proximal resection margin is inked black and the distal resection margin is inked red.  The radial/mesenteric resection margin is inked green.  The circumferential serosal margin is also inked black.  Two perforations are found on the sigmoid colon measuring 3.8 x 3 cm in greatest dimension and 2.5 x 2 cm in greatest dimension.  The two perforations are found within the inked circumferential serosal margin.  Adhered midway through the sigmoid colon is a second horizontal segment of large bowel (6.5 cm in length by 2.5 cm in diameter).  Both resection margins on the second segment of large bowel are inked black and the radial/mesenteric resection margin is inked green.  The serosal surface of the interface between both segments of bowel is inked yellow.  The sigmoid colon is opened to reveal a large and circumferential mucinous and polypoid tan-red to white mass measuring 7 cm in circumference by 6 cm in length.  The mass grossly approaches 5 cm within the proximal resection margin, 5 cm within the distal resection margin and 1 cm within the radial/mesenteric resection margin.  The mass extends to the circumferential serosal margin and protrudes through at both perforation site.  The mass does not grossly appear to invade the second smaller segment of large bowel.  No grossly abnormal findings are found within the second smaller segment of large bowel.  A tan polyp measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm is found in the sigmoid colon located 1 cm away from the proximal resection margin.  The remainder of the sigmoid colon appears grossly normal.

Microsatellite Instability PCR

Comment:  This tumor showed no evidence of microsatellite instability by PCR.  It is unlikely that this patient has Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC), however, 5% of patients with HNPCC have MSS colorectal adenocarcinomas.  Microsatellite stability in this neoplasm is associated with the presence of the mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2).  Microsatellite stability by PCR in cases with complete or equivocal loss of one or more mismatch repair proteins indicates the immunohistochemistry results were due to fixation or tissue processing factors or other unrelated epigenomic alteration.

Identification of microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) subsets of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data suggests microsatellite instability status is associated with prognosis and response to 5-FU based chemotherapy.

Methodology:  Non-tumor/normal and tumor areas were identified and selectively microdissected.  The collected cells were lysed and genomic DNA was extracted.  A multiplex PCR was used to amplify five mononucleotide repeat regions from both tumor and matched non-tumor/normal DNA and amplified products were evaluated by capillary electrophoresis.  Tumors containing DNA that generated novel products and/or demonstrated a size shift of three or more base pairs when compared to products generated from matched non-tumor/normal DNA were determined to exhibit microsatellite instability.

Intended Use:  Repetitive DNA is particularly sensitive to errors in replication and therefore dysfunctional mismatch repair genes result in widespread alterations in microsatellite regions.  Microsatellite instability (MSI) testing is used to evaluate five different microsatellite loci for instability.  MSI has been found in over 90% of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)-associated colorectal tumors and is a hallmark of this syndrome.  MSI has also been found in 10-20% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas and 5-FU therapy has been reported not to improve survival in these tumors in some studies (Benatti P et al., Clin Cancer Res **ID-NUM 2005)./r/n"

A.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled ""sigmoid colon from margins"" is a resected segment of tan-pink 
  intestinal tissue measuring 22.0 cm in length x 4.0 cm average outside diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink.  
  Opening reveals a tan-pink mucosa with a centrally ulcerated tan-pink to red mass lesion measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm, 
  located 1.5 cm from the distal margin and greater 15.0 cm from proximal margin.  Sectioning of the lesion reveals gross 
  invasion of the muscle area and invasion into surrounding fat.  Sectioning through fat overlying the lesion reveals the multiple 
  matted nodes measuring up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.  No further masses or lesions are grossly identified.

Received in formalin is an unoriented, unopened segment of bowel, 22.9 cm in length, and 4.9 cm in circumference at the proximal margin (orange), and 4.9 cm circumference at the distal margin (blue-marked with a suture).

There is a pedunculated, irregular, tan to pink polypoid mass, up to 4.1 x 2.4 x 2.0 cm, 13.2 cm from the proximal (blue) margin, and 7.5 cm from the distal (orange) margin.  The polypoid mass does not appear to involve the underlying lamina propria.  The polypoid mass encompasses >75% of the lumen.  

There is an area of narrowing of the lumen, starting 7.6 cm from the proximal margin, and ending at the polypoid mass described above.  This area of decreased lumen coincides with an area of adhesion of the mesentery on the serosal surface.  The mesentery encompasses the entire circumference of the bowel at the area of narrowing.

The results were reported by **NAME[UUU TTT], M.D. of Clarient Diagnostics Services, Aliso Viejo, CA on **DATE[Dec 6 2011].


Methodology:  Tumor areas were identified, selectively microdissected and lysed, and DNA extracted.  Real-time PCR was using eight primer sets was used to amplify the region of the KRAS gene containing codons 12 and 13.  A set of eight probes was used to specifically detect the wild-type and mutant sequences.

Intended Use:  The KRAS mutation analysis by real-time PCR detects the wild-type sequence and seven known mutations associated with codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS oncogene.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation to 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  Tumors harboring a KRAS mutation show relative insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase receptor therapies that signal through the RAS/RAF pathway.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management

Prognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or histopathological findings.

This assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by **INSTITUTION.  Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA  88, this laboratory has established the test s accuracy and precision.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as the FDA has determined that such approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

METHODS:  MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from block A6 and A10.

Controls were appropriately positive for each immunohistochemical stain.  Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.
ResultsComments:
Concurrent loss of both MLH1 and PMS2 expression is typical as they are binding partners and this pattern suggests the mutation is within the MLH1 gene.  Thus, the immunohistochemical profile suggests microsatellite unstable carcinomas and their respective adenomas related to loss of MLH1 mismatch repair protein function.  Given the synchronous nature of the lesions and loss of MMR proteins in both the adenoma and carcinoma, further evaluation by a genetics counselor at the **INSTITUTION (phone: **PHONE) is highly recommended."

B.  Received fresh labeled ""XXXXXX, left colon"" are two unoriented segments of colon, the larger of which measures up to 32.0 cm in greatest length x 13.2 cm in greatest circumference.  

The smaller segment of bowel measures up to 11.0 cm in length x 5.0 cm in greatest diameter.  The smaller segment consists 
of two segments sutured together, with a small amount of fibrous adhesions at the center.  

The larger segment is opened to reveal a circumferential tumor measuring up to 5.5 x 6.0 x 1.25 cm in greatest dimension.  The 
mass lesion has a central area of ulceration, and necrosis.  The mass is approximately 4.0 cm from one end of the bowel, and 
approximately 32.0 cm away from the opposite end.  The overlying surface of the tumor is inked black, and the margin closest 
to the tumor is inked blue.  

Sectioning of the tumor reveals that it invades through the  muscularis propria, and possibly into the fat.  No other mass 
lesions are present within the larger segment of bowel. 

Opening of the smaller segment of bowel reveals multiple red polyps, the largest of which measures up to 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm in

B.  Proximal and distal margins are free of carcinoma.  The circumferential mucosal mass is an invasive malignancy extending through the muscular wall into subserosal areas.  Tumor closely approaches the overlying serosa.  Tumor is composed of nests and sheets of fairly monotonous cells exhibiting areas of necrosis.  There is extensive lymphovascular tumor infiltration.  6 of 21 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic tumor.  Additional sections of bowel demonstrate a small pedunculated tubulovillous adenoma.  Based on the monotony of the main tumor, special stains are evaluated (CDX2, LCA, CD56, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, mucin).  These demonstrate no evidence of intracytoplasmic mucin staining.  Tumor cells are positive for CDX2 and negative for LCA, CD56, Chromogranin and Synaptophysin.  While cells have a monotonous, possible neuroendocrine appearance, immunostaining does not support neuroendocrine differentiation.","A: Peritoneal biopsy

The pleural surface is red to pink, focally congested and predominantly smooth, displaying a few fibrous adhesions on the medial aspect.  Sectioning reveals a 5.3 x 4.1 x 4.0cm tan, granular, ill defined, obstructing endobronchial tumor, within the hilum, which extends to within 0.6cm of the bronchial margin of resection.  The tumor invades through the bronchial wall into the surrounding parenchyma and surrounds the pulmonary artery and vein with no evidence of invasion.  The tumor involves the superior and inferior segments of the upper lobe and the medial basal and posterior basal segments of the lower lobe.  The tumor extends to within 0.4cm of the pleural surface.  The remaining parenchyma is diffusely congested and subcrepitant.  No discrete areas of consolidation are identified.  The bronchi distal to the aforementioned tumor are filled with thick gray mucus.

AddendumComment:
  Immunohistochemical Studies:  Immunohistochemical stains are performed on a selected node for further subclassification of this metastatic tumor (napsin, p63, TTF1, CK5 6, CA19.9, CDX2, CK7, CK20, p16, PSA, PSAP, and CEA.  Tumor cells are positive for CK7 and show focal expression of CK20.  They appear essentially negative for CDX2, CA9, PSA and PSAP.  Significant expression of TTF1 or napsin are not noted.  The metastatic tumor appears negative for mucin. 

  The immunohistochemical findings are not specific or diagnostic in assessment of potential primary sites.  The differential diagnosis includes, but is not limited to, possible upper gastrointestinal primary, genitourinary (bladder), and others.  While the differential diagnosis could include poorly differentiated non small cell carcinoma of pulmonary primary, there is no evidence of expression of TTF1 and Napsin in this case.  

The immunostain interpretations were reviewed for consensus diagnosis through intradepartmental consultation (Dr. **NAME[YYY XXX]) on **DATE[Aug 30 2012].

The specimen\X0D\\X0A\consists of a radical prostatectomy with attached segments of seminal\X0D\\X0A\vesicles and apparent detached tubular segments of vas deferens.  The\X0D\\X0A\main prostatectomy specimen body measures 5.3 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm.  The right\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm, and the left measures 3.0 x\X0D\\X0A\1.6 x 1.4 cm.  The short stump-like segment of possible right and left\X0D\\X0A\vas deferens is noted on the base near the insertion point of the\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicles.  The outer surface is shaggy gray-tan over the body of\X0D\\X0A\the prostate.  The right side is inked black, and the left side is inked\X0D\\X0A\blue over the anterior and posterior capsular surfaces.  The right\X0D\\X0A\seminal vesicle is also inked black, and the left seminal vesicle is\X0D\\X0A\also inked blue.  A small amount of irregular rubbery tissue is noted\X0D\\X0A\anterior to the seminal vesicles over both the right and left sides,\X0D\\X0A\bordering the bladder neck margin.  This tissue is included in the\X0D\\X0A\differential inking.  The seminal vesicles and vas deferens are then\X0D\\X0A\amputated at their bases, and the body of the prostate overall weighs\X0D\\X0A\49.3 grams.  The apex and bladder base margins are both removed in a\X0D\\X0A\conical fashion, and both are submitted in a radial sectioned pattern as\X0D\\X0A\follows:\X0D\\X0A\1 - right side apex\X0D\\X0A\2 - left side apex\X0D\\X0A\3 - right side bladder base\X0D\\X0A\4 - left side bladder base.\X0D\\X0A\The gland is then divided into the right and left halves, and the right\X0D\\X0A\half is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal generally\X0D\\X0A\heterogeneous pink to yellow-tan rubbery tissue with a few cystic spaces\X0D\\X0A\between 0.2 to 0.3 cm, and a gray-tan nodule measuring up to 0.6 cm near\X0D\\X0A\the mid point between the anterior and posterior lobes.  No necrosis is\X0D\\X0A\observed.  The superior soft tissues show dense rubbery white-tan\X0D\\X0A\indurated tissue and softer amounts of lobulated yellow adipose tissue.\X0D\\X0A\The left side of the prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a rubbery\X0D\\X0A\similar consistency throughout with a few white-tan nodules between 0.3\X0D\\X0A\to 1.2 cm noted.  No necrosis is observed.  Sectioning through the right\X0D\\X0A\and left seminal vesicles shows no focal lesions.  Four additional\X0D\\X0A\detached fragments of rubbery soft tissue are noted ranging in size from\X0D\\X0A\1.2 to 3.6 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm.  These appear to represent possible\X0D\\X0A\additional portions of either seminal vesicle or vas deferens.\X0D\\X0A\Additional representative sections including the vast majority of the\X0D\\X0A\gland, are submitted as follows:\X0D\\X0A\5 through 10 - right side of the prostate\X0D\\X0A\11 - rubbery soft tissue superior to the right prostate\X0D\\X0A\12 - shaved right vas deferens margin, and right seminal vesicle\X0D\\X0A\representative\X0D\\X0A\13 through 18 - left side of the prostate\X0D\\X0A\19 - rubbery soft tissue superior to the left prostate\X0D\\X0A\20 - shaved left vas deferens margin, and left seminal vesicle\X0D\\X0A\representative\X0D\\X0A\21 and 22 - random sections of additional four separate soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\fragments.\X0D\\X0A\DRJ:jlj","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\Sections show infiltrating Gleason pattern 3 prostatic adenocarcinoma\X0D\\X0A\within one high-power field of the right side apical margin, with tumor\X0D\\X0A\foci extending to involve the inked left side apical margin (slide\X0D\\X0A\A2-1).  The right bladder base margin is focally involved by\X0D\\X0A\adenocarcinoma, and the left bladder base margin appears more\X0D\\X0A\extensively involved by adenocarcinoma with a few foci representing\X0D\\X0A\Gleason pattern 4.

The tumor focally involves the right peripheral soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\margin, at the anterior aspect.  No definitive perineural invasion is\X0D\\X0A\identified.  Sections of the soft tissue described on the right bladder\X0D\\X0A\base side show a portion of benign urinary bladder wall with patchy mild\X0D\\X0A\chronic inflammation and an intact urothelium.

Received are two containers labeled '**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000599655' and a requisition with 
'**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000599655'. The specimens are placed in formalin between 1016 and 1230, 
**DATE[Feb 16 12], for a total fixation time of between 10.5 and 12.5 hours. 
The first is designated 'left skin-sparing mastectomy' and is received without fixative. It 
is a 758 gm skin-sparing breast 21.0 cm from medial to lateral, 22.0 cm from superior to 
inferior, and 4.0 cm from superficial to deep. There is an attached 11.5 x 5.3 cm skin 
ellipse which has an everted unremarkable nipple. At 6.5 cm inferolateral to the nipple's 
edge is a 1.7 cm healed incision. The deep margin has no attached muscle. Orientation is 
short suture superior and long lateral. The specimen is inked: 2.0 cm band superior to 
skin ellipse -green, 2.0 cm band inferior to skin ellipse -yellow, remaining 
superoanterior margin -orange, remaining inferoanterior margin -blue, deep margin -black. 
The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral into 18 slices. The cut surface has two 
gross areas of interest which are separate. The first gross area of interest is in slices 
8-15 at approximately 4:00 to 5:00, 4.0 cm from the nipple, in the lower outer quadrant. 
This is what appears to be a single irregular mass which is somewhat ill-defined and has 
gross evidence of biopsy. The mass is 3.5 x 2.5 x an estimated 4.0 cm on the medial to 
lateral axis. The mass is 0.4 cm from the blue inferoanterior margin and 0.4 cm from the 
black deep margin. It is over 2.0 cm from the orange superoanterior margin, 1.5 cm from the 
yellow band inferior to the skin ellipse, and 0.8 cm from the green band superior to the 
skin ellipse. Intraoperative gross margin consultation by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] of: `4.0 cm mass 
in lower outer quadrant, 4 mm from deep and anteroinferior margins'. 
The second gross area of interest is in slices 15 and 16 at approximately 2:00. This is a 
1.5 x 0.8 cm firm, circumscribed area which appears consistent with an interparenchymal 
lymph node. This is over 2.0 cm from all margins. 
Summary of Sections: 
A1 Slice 6 -nipple 
A2 Slice 14 -healed incision on skin which corresponds to more lateral portion of 
mass 
A3 First gross area of interest -slice 8, yellow band inferior to skin ellipse 
A4 Slice 9 -first gross area of interest, blue inferoanterior 
A5 Slice 10 -first gross area of interest, apparent biopsy site, blue and yellow 
band inferior to skin ellipse 
A6 Slice 13 -green band superior to skin ellipse and mass 
A7 Slice 14 -black deep 
A8 Slice 15 second gross area of interest -what appears to be an intrarparenchymal lymph 
node, no marginal ink 
The second is designated 'left axillary dissection' and is received in formalin. It is 
unoriented orange-yellow adipose tissue 15.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. This has tentatively 
identified lymph nodes up to 2.5 cm with several of these lymph nodes white and firm. One 
of the lymph nodes appears to have gross evidence of biopsy.

  Unstained sections are prepared and regions of invasive carcinoma are marked
  by comparison with H&E-stained sections from the same block.  Fluorescence in
  situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA-
  approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit.  The prepared slides are then
  viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the
  chromosome 17 probe (green), the Her-2/neu probe (orange) and DNA (blue) to
  localize nuclei.  Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of
  Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed.  Control slides from non-
  amplified and low-level amplified tumor cells are prepared simultaneously to
  ensure reproducibility between assays.  Results are listed in the table below:

equivocal (score of 2+), negative for overexpression by FISH studies.

B.  Residual Breast Tissue, Excision:
Benign fibroadipose tissue.
No ductal epithelium present.
Negative for atypia or malignancy.

<COMMENT>
Review of the medical record indicates that the patient had a left
breast lumpectomy for cancer in 1993 that included axillary lymph node
dissection and radiation therapy. DCIS is intermixed within and
extending slightly beyond the infiltrating carcinoma, and it measures
approximately 1 cm across. A separate hemorrhagic focus in the 1 o'clock
region appears to be fat necrosis and inflammatory response. No
malignancy is identified in that site.

INTRAPROCEDURAL EVALUATION:
A.  Left breast (gross exam): ""Hematoma, makes difficult assessment of
tumor in relation to margin"".
Performed by:  **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], M.D.

<GROSS>
A.  Received fresh, labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M]"", and designated ""left
breast"" and is submitted for rapid evaluation yielding the above
intraprocedural evaluation by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY]. The above
intraprocedural evaluation is called into Dr. **NAME[XXX] in the operating
room by Dr. **NAME[YYY]. It consists of an oriented simple mastectomy
specimen with a single suture designated as marking medial. It is 418
grams, 16 cm superior to inferior, by 12.5 cm medial to lateral, by 5 cm
superficial to deep. It is without an axillary tail. It is partially
covered by a 6.5 x 5 cm ellipse of unremarkable skin with a 1.2 x 1 cm
everted nipple. Prior to dissection, it is inked as follows:  Superior
superficial orange, inferior superficial green, and deep black. It Is
then sectioned from medial to lateral into 19 cross-sectional slices
numbered respectively. The cut surfaces are 30% fibrous and 70% fatty.
Slices 3-7 (mid to superior) have a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm ill-defined
hemorrhagic area that is less than 0.1 cm from the superior superficial
surface, 5.3 cm from the nipple, 1.8 cm from the deep margin, and 4 cm
from the superior skin margin. Within this hemorrhagic area in slices 5
and 6 is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm ill-defined, firm, white-pink nodular area
that is 1.2 cm from the deep margin, 1.1 cm from the superior
superficial margin, 5.5 cm from the nipple, and 6 cm from the superior
skin margin. The tumor has a centrally placed M-clip. This hemorrhagic
area and nodular area correlate with the prior biopsy at 11 o'clock.
Slices 7-10 (mid to superior) have a 1.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm ill-defined,
hemorrhagic, fibrous area with calcified material. This area is 3 cm
from the superior skin margin, less than 0.1-0.2 cm from the superior
superficial margin, 2.8 cm from the hemorrhagic area, 3 cm from the
nipple, and 5 cm from the deep margin. This biopsy has a metallic clip.
This second area correlates with the prior 1 o'clock biopsy site.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1- nipple; A2- middle
of slice 1 medial aspect-uninked, superior and inferior slice 2; A3-
medial aspect of hemorrhagic area in slice 3 including superficial
margin; A4- hemorrhagic area from slice 4; A5, A6- nodular area within
hemorrhagic area of slices 5 and 6 (A6 includes superficial margin); A7-
deep margin from slices 5 and 6; A8- hemorrhagic area from slice 7 (most
lateral aspect of larger hemorrhagic area); A9- tissue from the middle
of slice 7 between hemorrhagic area in slices 3-7 and ill-defined
hemorrhagic fibrous area with calcified material in slices 7-10; A10-
superior and inferior slice 7; A11-A13- second ill-defined hemorrhagic
fibrous area with calcified material from slices 7 through 10; A14- mid
deep, superior, and inferior slice 10; A15- middle uninked, superior,
and inferior slice 13; A16- superior and inferior slice 16 and
middle-uninked slice 19. kjh/ct

B.  Received in formalin, labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M]."" and designated
""residual breast tissue"", are three irregular, unoriented pieces of
fibrofatty tissue, 4 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm (green ink), 5.3 x 4 x 0.9 cm (blue
ink), and 5.5 x 4.6 x 1 cm (black ink). Each piece is serially
sectioned. The cut surfaces are 98% fatty and 2% fibrous. No discrete
tumors of nodules are identified. Representative sections are submitted
in B1-B3. (kjh/jmk)

  examined along with the original report to select the most appropriate block
  containing invasive carcinoma for this additional molecular testing (block
  D8). After the selected block was retrieved from storage and appropriate
  slides cut, material was sent to Genomic Health for testing and the results
  were reported as follows:
  The OncotypeDX recurrence score is: 17 (11% rate of distant recurrence at 10
  years for node negative, ER-positive cancers treated with tamoxifen).
  The OncotypeDX quantitative Estrogen Receptor score is: 9.3 (with positive >
  6.5).
  The OncotypeDX quantitative Progesterone Receptor score is: 6.0 (with positive
  > 5.5).
  The OncotypeDX quantitative Her2 score is: 9.6 (with positive >11.5 and
  negative < 10.7).NOTE:   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical

COMMENTS
In a subset of breast carcinoma cases showing increased CEP17 signal copy
number by FISH, studies have shown that calculating the HER2:CEP17 ratio may
not reflect the actual HER2 amplification status (Troxell, ML et al., AJCP
2006;**ID-NUM). Because both the HER2 and CEP17 signals were significantly
elevated in this case, we assessed this tumor for alternative chromosome 17
loci (SMS, RARA, and P53 genes) in order to determine if evaluation of the
copy number for these alternative chromosome 17 loci, could lead to a
significantly increased HER2:Chromosome 17 ratio. The results for these
additional FISH studies demonstrated that these loci were elevated to a
similar degree as the CEP17 copy number. Therefore, the HER2:chromosome 17
ratio is not elevated and this case should be considered NEGATIVE for HER2
amplification.

HER2 FISH.
METHODOLOGY
HER2 FISH testing is performed according to ASCO-CAP guidelines (Wolff AC et
al., J Clin Oncol 25:**PHONE). FISH testing for the purpose of alternative
chromosome 17 enumeration using probes to the SMS, RARA, and P53 loci has been
independently validated. Methods: Deparaffinized sections of tissue,
following pretreatment, are incubated with PathVysion    HER2 probe kit (**NAME[ZZZ]
**PLACE, IL) containing 2 separate probes: a locus-specific HER2
gene probe (17p11.2-q12 ) and a reference chromosome 17 centromere probe
(CEP17; 17p11.1-q11.1). Separate, similarly treated tissue section slides are
incubated with an **PLACE, IL) and a P53 (**PLACE, IL) probe, the later also containing a CEP17 probe.
Morphometric image analysis is performed using a MetaSystems    platform and
Metafer 4    application software. The HER2 and CEP17 signals are counted per
tile/nucleus and the HER2:CEP17 ratio is calculated. Similarly, the SMS/**NAME[CCC]
and P53 signals are also enumerated per nucleus. FISH Scoring: 
Results are scored as positive, negative, or equivocal for amplification based on
evaluation of the signal copy numbers for the alternative chromosome 17 loci.
Test Validation: The test methodology for HER2/CEP17 FISH testing employed in
this laboratory has demonstrated an extremely high concordance rate between
IHC and FISH (Gown AM et al., Mod Pathol **ID-NUM, 2008; Yaziji H et al.,
JAMA **ID-NUM, 2004). In the most recent study of 6604 patients, a 99.2%
concordance was demonstrated between negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC and
non-amplified HER2 FISH, and a 94.7% concordance was demonstrated between
positive (3+) HER2 IHC and amplified HER2 FISH. Quality Assurance: PhenoPath
Laboratories has in place a quality assurance program for HER2 FISH, which
includes daily controls (cell lines and tissues), Levy-Jennings analysis of
HER2 controls, and ongoing concordance studies between IHC and FISH, to ensure
high levels of interobserver and methodology concordance. . *PhenoPath
Laboratories' HER2 validation and ongoing monitoring of IHC and FISH assays
demonstrate extremely high concordance (>95%) that is independent of the
reported duration of fixation.

Right breast cancer.

<GROSS>
Received in a TranSpec container containing formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast lump,' is an unoriented 7.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm right breast lumpectomy with an inserted localization wire.  The accompanying radiograph reveals a metallic clip adjacent to the tip of the wire.  The outer surface of the breast tissue is inked blue in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical resection margins.  Sectioning of the breast tissue reveals a hemorrhagic biopsy cavity measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  This prior biopsy cavity comes to within 0.2 cm of the nearest resection margin.  Additional distinct masses or nodules are not identified.  The remainder of the lumpectomy grossly appears to be comprised of approximately 60% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 40% white to pink fibrous tissue.  The breast tissue is submitted in its entirety in cassettes A1-A22.  The prior biopsy site is found within cassettes A6-A11.

Sections examined.  Patchy atypical lobular hyperplasia is present and focally the changes are consistent with lobular carcinoma in situ.  No LCIS is seen at the excision margins.  A focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia is also seen adjacent to the healing biopsy site, but it does not cross a threshold for a diagnosis of DCIS.  Block A16 has a sclerosing duct proliferation, as well as the in situ lobular proliferation, and that block is marked with immunohistochemical stains, which demonstrate that the sclerosing lesion has maintenance of myoepithelial smooth muscle myosin heavy chain expression indicative of a benign lesion.  The in situ lobular process has loss of E-cadherin expression indicating it is lobular rather than ductal. 
The findings are correlated with the operative report in ACIS EMR, which states this patient had a 'Newly diagnosed right breast cancer which is lobular carcinoma in situ on the extensive background of atypical ductal hyperplasia.  The patient was taken for surgery for lumpectomy to ensure there is no more lobular carcinoma in situ as well as no other carcinoma beyond the lobular carcinoma in situ, with intention of obtaining a good margin.'  No prior pathology is available in FHS pathology system for comparison.  
This case has undergone prospective intradepartmental departmental quality assurance review prior to verification.

The lymph node is bisected and a touch prep is performed yield the following diagnosis Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  'No metastatic carcinoma identified on touch prep'.  The bisected lymph node is submitted in its entirety for permanent section in cassette A1.
B.  Received fresh in a TranSpec container, labeled with the patient's name and without a specimen source designation, is an oriented right breast lumpectomy measuring 5.0 cm medial to lateral, 4.5 cm superior to inferior, and 0.6 cm anterior to posterior.  The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a short suture designating the superior resection margin and a long suture designating the lateral resection margin.  Entering the medial-anterior aspect of the breast is a localization wire.  A radiograph is not received with the specimen.  The lumpectomy is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical resection margins in the following manner:  the superior resection margin is inked blue, the inferior resection margin is inked green, the medial resection margin is inked violet, the lateral resection margin is inked orange, the anterior resection margin is inked yellow, and the posterior resection margin is inked black.  Sectioning of the lumpectomy reveals a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm gritty white-gray mass within the medial half of the breast.  This mass abuts the posterior resection margin and comes to within 0.2 cm of the anterior resection margin.  The mass is 1.0 cm from the inferior resection margin and 2.0 cm from the superior resection margin.  A metallic spring-like clip is present within the central aspect of the mass.  Additional distinct masses or nodules are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the lumpectomy grossly appears to be comprised of approximately 60% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 40% white to pink fibrous tissue.

PART 2: RIGHT BREAST
(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated """"right breast, suture marks axillary"""" is an apparent simple mastectomy specimen weighing 430 grams and measuring 20 cm medial-lateral, 16.5 cm superior-inferior and up to 3 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary area of the excision is marked with a suture on the container label and requisition form. The specimen is also surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 15.5 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.4 cm. The skin is notable for two red-maroon, flat, discolored lesions, each measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, and deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals a solid, firm, suspicious-appearing neoplasm in the central superior aspect of the excision. The lesion measures 2.2 x 2 cm. It is removed from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue margin. The nearest inked margin to the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue margin at a distance of 1.5 cm each. The lesion on cut section features solid hemorrhagic areas, along with a deeply embedded metallic clip. The remainder of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed mainly of bright yellow fatty tissue with strips of pink-white fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the superior-lateral most aspect of the excision reveals two lymph node/nodules measuring 0.6 and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension which are fat replaced on cut section. 

Summary of sections: 2a-sections skin and nipple; 2b-green inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2c-black inked soft tissue margin close to breast lesion; 2d through 2f-representative sections breast lesion central superior breast; 2g, 2h-sections upper outer quadrant of breast; 2i, 2j-sections lower outer quadrant of breast; 2k, 2l-sections upper inner quadrant of breast; 2m, 2n-sections lower inner quadrant of breast; 2o-two bisected axillary lymph nodes/nodules
 
PART 3: HIGHEST LEFT AXILLARY NODE

PART 4: LEFT MODIFIED MASTECTOMY 
(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled **NAME[AAA BBB], designated """"left modified mastectomy, suture marks axilla"""" is a modified radical mastectomy specimen weighing 457 grams. The axillary tail is marked with a suture. The breast tissue portion measures 15.5 cm medial-lateral, 15 cm superior-inferior and up to 4 cm anterior-posterior. The axillary tail measures 8 x 6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is surmounted by an elliptoid portion of yellow-pink skin measuring 16 x 8.5 cm. The nipple is everted measuring 1.3 cm. The 4 to 8 o'clock aspect of the areola complex has a purple-red discoloration. Otherwise, no skin lesion is grossly appreciated. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, deep posterior-black. Sectioning the breast reveals an ill-defined malignant appearing neoplasm in the central upper outer quadrant of the breast. The lesion measures 3 x 2.2 cm. The lesion has a solid, smooth, yellow-white cut surface with strips of hemorrhagic areas. The lesion is also remote from the cutaneous and inked soft tissue margins. The nearest inked margins of the lesion are the green and black inked soft tissue margins with a distance of 1 cm each. The rest of the breast tissue parenchyma is composed of bright yellow fatty tissue alternating with pink-white, fibrous tissue. No other suspicious mass is grossly appreciated. Thorough examination of the attached axillary tail reveals several lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 up to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.

PART 5: RIGHT BREAST
(**INITIALS) Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated """"right breast, stitch lateral, other stitch axillary tail."""" The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy which weighs 630 grams and measures 25 x 22 x 5 cm. Present is a 10.4 x 5.7 cm ellipse of tan-brown skin containing its 4 cm areolar and a 1.2 cm nipple. With the specimen oriented per the sutures placed by the surgeon, the specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, and deep/posterior-black. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral and shows a non-descript fibrofatty tissue without localizing lesions suspicious for neoplasm. In the region of the axillary tail two lymph nodes are identified measuring 0.5 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. 

Summary of sections: 5a-nipple and skin; 5b-one lymph node, trisected; 5c-other lymph node bisected; 5d, 5e-upper outer quadrant; 5f, 5g-upper inner quadrant; 5h, 5i-lower outer quadrant; 5j, 5k, lower inner quadrant.

PART 6: LEFT BREAST
(**INITIALS) The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated """"left breast."""" The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy which weighs 690 grams and measures 27 x 23 x 5 cm. The specimen includes a 10.5 x 6.0 cm ellipse of tan-brown skin with a 3.5 cm areola and 1 cm everted nipple. The skin and nipple appear grossly unremarkable. The specimen is oriented by several sutures placed by the surgeon. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-green, inferior-orange, medial-red, lateral-purple, and deep/posterior-black. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral and the slices are numbered 1-12 from medial to lateral. Identified in slice #5 is a 0.9 cm circumscribed tumor nodule which is grossly situated 1.5 from the posterior margin, 4.5 cm from the nipple and greater than 5 cm from the medial, superior, inferior, and lateral margins. Situated approximately 1 cm from this mass lesion is a second area of parenchymal abnormality which measures approximately 1.0 cm in dimension and has a firm and hemorrhagic cut surface. Grossly, this appears to be consistent with a previous biopsy site. This lesion is situated 2 cm from the posterior margin and greater than 5 cm from the other margins. This lesion is located in slices #6 and #7. The remainder of the breast tissue has a non-descript fibrofatty appearance without other identifiable mass lesions.

<GROSS>
  Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""right breast
10:00 5 CFN"" are four irregular yellow-tan fibroadipose needle cores, 4.5
cm in aggregate length, AE/(4).
<MICROSCOPIC>
  Sections show several cores of breast tissues with areas of fat necrosis
and dense fibrosis. On three of the core biopsies, in areas of dense
fibrosis, there are nests of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. The
presence of these epithelial cells is confirmed with an immunostain for
pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Invasive tumor spans a greatest area of up to
2.8 mm on a single core. 
Slides from the previous breast cancer are not in our files for a direct
histologic comparison but given the location within scar tissues and the
adjacent fat necrosis this is likely near the site of a previous surgical
procedure and could be recurrent tumor. The possibility of a new primary
carcinoma arising at this site can not be completely excluded.

Fixation Time:  Within Guideline Limits (See comment).
: Negative estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her-2/neu
results may be unreliable in cases where fixation time is shorter than
guideline limits suggest. 
Interpretation: Estrogen/progesterone receptor evaluation is based on the
**NAME[XXX] Scoring system.  An **NAME[XXX] score of 3 to 8 is considered positive.
Formalin-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections (along with appropriate
positive controls) are incubated with the following monoclonal and/or
polyclonal antibodies. Localization is via a biotin-free multimer-based
immunoperoxidase technique according to an optimized protocol. The
controls are reviewed for the appropriate positive and negative reactivity
and found to be satisfactory. Results on the population(s) of interest are
as indicated above. 
 
These tests were developed and their performance characteristics were
determined by the Department of Anatomic Pathology at Group Health

Left breast cancer, previous right breast CA with mastectomy.  Per outside report (**ID-NUM), immunohistochemistry stains were performed on the biopsy from **DATE[Mar 19 2012] and the tumor is negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2.  Ki-67 demonstrated a high proliferative index of >50%.

<GROSS>
Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated 'left breast tissue, short suture at Tail of **NAME[ZZZ], long suture marks tumor skin boundary,' is a 160 gm simple left mastectomy specimen with short suture designating Tail of **NAME[ZZZ] and long suture marking tumor skin boundary, per the requisition.  The breast measures 9.1 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 15.3 cm from medial to lateral.  A tan-pink skin ellipse is present on the anterior surface measuring 13.8 cm from medial to lateral x 8.1 cm from superior to inferior.  A V-shaped incision is present on the left tip of the skin ellipse, which measures 7.2 cm from superior to inferior, and is located 1.5 cm from the most lateral skin tip.  An everted nipple measuring 1.1 cm in diameter x 0.9 cm in length is located in the central aspect of the skin, with a 3.1 cm areolar surrounding the nipple.  The specimen is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  anterior-superior resection margin   blue, anterior-inferior resection margin   green, and posterior resection margin   black.  Sectioning reveals a firm, round, well-circumscribed mass measuring 1.5 cm from medial to lateral, 1.3 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.3 cm from anterior to posterior.  The mass is located 0.1 cm from the closest black-inked posterior resection margin, 0.9 cm from the closest blue-inked anterior-superior resection margin, 2.0 cm from the closest green-inked anterior-inferior resection margin, 0.8 cm deep to the skin, and 7.0 cm from the nipple.  The mass is located in the lower-outer quadrant.  The mass has a tan-white homogeneous and rubbery cut surface.  The mass is located 0.9 cm deep to the skin incision.  Located 1.0 cm from the mass is an ill-defined nodule area of tan-white dense fibrous tissue, measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  A localization clip is identified within the central portion of the mass.  The breast immediately deep to the nipple is tan-white to chalky white soft and friable, grossly appearing to be necrotic.  The remaining uninvolved breast tissue consists of approximately 40% tan-white dense fibrous tissue admixed with 60% tan-yellow, glistening and lobulated unremarkable breast tissue.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of sections:  A1 nipple, A2 full thickness section through mass with closest black-inked posterior resection margin, A3 full thickness section through mass with closest blue inked anterior-superior resection margin and closest skin, A4 closest green-inked anterior-inferior margin, A5-A6 remainder of mass, A7 nodular fibrous tissue adjacent to mass, A8 soft and friable tissue deep to nipple, A9 representative upper-outer quadrant, A10 representative lower-outer quadrant, A11 representative upper-inner quadrant, A12 representative lower-inner quadrant.

INTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION:
A1TP:  Lymph node, one; negative for carcinoma (Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]).

<GROSS>
A.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name designated 'right axillary sentinel node' is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fat replaced tan to pink-yellow ovoid lymph node.  This lymph node is bisected and a touch prep is performed yielding the following diagnosis by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]:  Lymph node, one; negative for carcinoma.  The bisected lymph node is submitted in its entirety for permanent sectioning in cassette A1.
B.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right breast tissue' is an oriented right breast lumpectomy measuring 10.5 cm medial to lateral, 7.0 cm superior to inferior, and up to 4.5 cm anterior to posterior.  The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a double suture designating the posterior resection margin, a single suture designating the lateral resection margin, and a localization wire and skin representing the anterior margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 4.5 cm medial to lateral x 1.0 cm superior to inferior.  The skin surface is grossly unremarkable.  A skin mass or lesion is not identified.  The lumpectomy is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical resection margins in the following manner:  The superior resection margin is inked blue, the inferior resection margin is inked green, the medial resection margin is inked violet, the lateral resection margin is inked orange, the anterior resection margin is inked yellow, the posterior resection margin is inked black.  Sectioning of the lumpectomy reveals a gritty white to pink-gray 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm mass within the anterior-inferior aspect of the lumpectomy.  A spring-like metallic clip is embedded within the mass.  The mass comes to within 0.8 cm of the anterior resection margin, 1.0 cm of the inferior resection margin, 1.5 cm of the superior resection margin, and 2.0 cm of the posterior resection margin.  The mass does not grossly appear to involve the overlying skin ellipse.  Additional distinct breast masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the lumpectomy is comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  The identified mass is submitted in its entirety.  Summary of sections:  B1 medial resection margin, B2 and B3 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast medial to mass, B4 and B5 breast mass with anterior and inferior resection margins, B6 breast mass with anterior, skin, and superior resection margin, B7 and B8 bicomposite section of uninvolved breast tissue lateral to breast mass, B9 lateral resection margin.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL RESULTS 
Deparaffinized tissue sections undergo optimized epitope retrieval prior to incubation with 
the appropriate antibody. Visualization is provided by an immunoperoxidase technique. 
Immunohistochemical staining is evaluated by visual examination of slides using a 
conventional light microscope and by computer-assisted morphometric analysis where noted. 
The positive and negative control slides for each immunohistochemical test are reviewed and 
found to exhibit the appropriate staining pattern. Results on the invasive carcinoma are as 
indicated in the table below 
Tests performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block: B1 
Antibody (clone): Result 
Estrogen receptor (ER) (SP1): 59% *** 
Progesterone receptor (PR) (PgR 636): 2% *** 
HER2 (HerceptTest Dako) 1+ **** 
***Hormone receptor scoring is performed quantitatively by computer-assisted morphometric 
analysis with an Applied Imaging Ariol system. Results are reported as positive for the 
percentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern when the 
percentage is greater than or equal to 1%. Results are reported as negative when the 
percentage of neoplastic cells that exhibit the expected staining pattern is less than 1%. 
****HER2 immunohistochemical slides are prepared with the Dako HercepTest (FDA method) 
following the procedures as outlined in the test kit. Separate 1+, 2+, and 3+ staining 
controls are provided for each run. Analysis is performed by quantitative computer-assisted 
morphometric analysis based on an appropriately trained Ariol (Applied Imaging) system. The 
immunostained signal is analyzed for each selected area of the invasive tumor. The final 
results are scored according to CAP-ASCO HER2 testing guidelines (Wolff et al., 2007) as 
negative (either 0 or 1+), equivocal (2+, requiring a calculated signal of at least 2+ in 
>10% of the selected tumor), or positive (3+, requiring a calculated signal of 3+ in >30% of 
the selected tumor). Validation studies are performed on a set of tumors for which 
immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results are known from 
outside studies performed by an external laboratory using validated methods. The validation 
set consists of 97 immunohistochemical results (which includes 33 external 3+ scores and 35 
external negative scores) and 49 FISH results (which consists of 16 positive results and 33 
negative results). Comparison of the internal immunohistochemical scores obtained by 
computer-assisted morphometric analysis with the external immunohistochemical scores reveals 
no discordance between immunohistochemical internal (negative, 3+) scores and external (3+, 
negative) scores, respectively. Specifically, identical results are found with all 33 of the 
externally scored 3+ cases and with 34 of the 35 externally scored negative cases, with one 
of the externally scored negative cases given an internal score of 2+ (equivocal). Cases 
possessing internal scores of negative or 3+ but which are externally scored as 2+ are found 
to possess negative and positive FISH results which are 100% concordant with the internal 
negative and 3+ immunohistochemical scores, respectively. Comparison of the internal 
immunohistochemical scores obtained by computer-assisted morphometric analysis with the 
external FISH scores reveals no discordance between immunohistochemical (negative, 3+) 
scores and FISH results. Specifically, all 22 internal negative immunohistochemical scores 
correspond to negative FISH results and all 14 internal 3+ immunohistochemical scores 
correspond to positive FISH results. The remaining 13 FISH results correspond to internal 2+ 
immunohistochemical scores.

Preop: Previous lumpectomy - right breast. Breast Ca UOQ. Right breast re-excision for margins (stitch medial aspect with skin anterior). The patient's surgical pathology record documents an outside biopsy with grade 1, ER and PR positive, HER2 negative, invasive ductal carcinoma, with subsequent excisional biopsy containing a 1.5 cm grade 1 invasive carcinoma, extending to within less than 0.5 mm of margin; sentinel lymph node biopsy showed a micrometastasis (***PATH-NUMBER[1]; selected slides reviewed).  

<HISTOLOGY COMMENT>



<GROSS>
The specimen is labeled ""right breast re-excision for margins"" and is received in formalin. It consists of an ovoid piece of fat-covered tissue surfaced by a skin ellipse which has a suture at one apex to indicate medial, and the skin ellipse itself is anterior. The skin ellipse measures 3.7 x 1.2 cm and has a linear scar running parallel to its long axis along most of its length. The specimen measures 4 cm in length from anterior to posterior including the skin ellipse, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 3 cm from superior to inferior. The external surface is now inked as follows: Medial - blue, lateral - green, posterior - black, anterior surrounding skin ellipse - yellow, superior - orange, and inferior - violet. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial perpendicular to the skin ellipse into thirteen slices. This reveals a central biopsy cavity measuring up to 1.5 x 0.5 cm (slice #6), surrounded by fibrotic-appearing white tissue. Residual tumor is not grossly apparent. The entire specimen is submitted sequentially from lateral to medial in cassettes A1-A13 (the medial tip of the skin ellipse is in A10). lj

Reason for Addendum #1:  Omitted information

<FINAL DX>     

A. Left Breast, 5:00, Wire-Localized Oriented Partial Mastectomy:
   Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with the following features:
      Histologic type:        Solid.
      Nuclear grade:          High.
      Necrosis:          Present.
      Size/Extent of DCIS:         Approximately 0.9 cm.
      Distribution of DCIS in specimen: Near biopsy site in the
mid-inferior half (slices 10-12 of 16).
      Microcalcifications:         Present, and associated with DCIS.
      Surgical margins:
         Anterior (superficial):        Negative (3 mm).
         Posterior (deep):         Negative (9mm).
         Superior:       Negative (>10 mm).
         Inferior:       Negative (>5 mm). (slide A19, See Comment)
         Medial:         Negative (>10 mm).
         Lateral:        Close (1 mm) (slides A15, A19).

      No invasive carcinoma identified.
   Additional findings:
Immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone receptor
expression has been previously performed (***PATH-NUMBER[2]), with the following
results: ER 5%, PR 0%

B. Left Breast, 5:00, New Inferior Margin, Oriented Resection:
       Benign fatty breast tissue.

<COMMENT>
In part A (partial mastectomy), there is focally DCIS 1 mm from the
green inked (marks inferior) cauterized surface at its junction with the
yellow inked (marks lateral) surface in slice 12 of 16 (slice 16 most
inferior).  This would place it approximately 12 mm from the absolute
inferior-most edge of the specimen.  Thus while the DCIS is focally
close to green ink, I interpret that this ink extends beyond what might
best be considered the inferior margin. Therefore, I consider that this
focus of DCIS is at least 5 mm from what would be considered the
inferior specimen margin.  The final inferior margin seems widely free,
as no DCIS was identified in the additional margin tissue (part B).

<CLINICAL INFO>
Left breast DCIS. Hydromarker fell out. The tissue was placed in
formalin at approximately 12:30 p.m. on **DATE[Dec 01 2011]. Total formalin

Right breast cancer 
<GROSS>: 
Five specimens are received without fixative, each labeled '**NAME[BBB, AAA]'. 
Part A is designated 'right breast partial mastectomy, long stitch medial, short stitch superior, 
wire is anterior'. It consists of an oriented fibrofatty tissue fragment weighing 66 grams and 
measuring 8.5 cm from superior to inferior, 6.5 cm from medial to lateral and 2.5 cm from 
anterior to posterior. The tail end of a localization guidewire extends centrally from the anterior 
aspect. 
WIth the provided orientation the specimen is inked as follows: 
Medial-Red 
Lateral-Yellow 
Superior-Orange 
Inferior-Green 
Anterior-Blue 
Deep-Black 

The specimen is serially sectioned from superior towards inferior into 12 slices with the hooked 
end of the guidewire terminating in slice 3. Sectioning reveals an indurated tan-white slightly ill-
defined mass occupying slices 6-8 and grossly measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm. Grossly the 
mass is 0.1 cm from the anterior margin (slice 6), 1.5 cm from the lateral margin, 1.5 cm from 
the medial margin, 2 cm from the deep margin, 2 cm from the inferior margin and 2.5 cm from 
the superior margin. The remainder of the specimen shows soft yellow fatty cut surfaces with a 
minimal fibrous component, although there is some dense fibrous tissue laterally adjacent to the 
mass in slice 8 which abuts the inked margin. There are otherwise no definite areas of 
abnormality. 
Sections are submitted as follows:A1-Perpendicular sections of slice 1 with superior margin. 
A2-Representative fibrous tissue in slice 4. 
A3-Fibrous tissue superiorly adjacent to mass, slice 5. 
A4-Slice 6, superior extent of mass with nearest inked anterior margin. 
A5-Slice 6, tissue and deep margin posterior adjacent to mass. 
A6-Tissue and medial margin adjacent to mass. 

A9-A10-Slice 8, mass in this slice with anterior and lateral margins (one section bisected). 
A11-Slice 9, fibrous tissue inferiorly adjacent to mass. 
A12-Representative perpendicular sections of slice 12 with inferior margin. 

Part B is designated 'sentinel nodes 1-3'. It consists of a soft to rubbery yellow-red fatty tissue 
fragment measuring 6 x 3.8 x 1.3 cm. Palpation and dissection of this tissue reveals three soft 
to rubbery yellow-red probable lymph nodes ranging from 1-2.5 cm in maximum dimension. 

The nodes are submitted as follows: 
B1-One node bisected. 
B2-One node bisected. 
B3-B4-One node quadrisected. 

Part C is designated 'additional right anterior margin'. It consists of an unoriented rubbery 
yellow-red fatty tissue fragment weighing 4.2 grams and measuring 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm. One aspect 
is slightly coarse and is the assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated assumed new 
margin is inked blue. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft yellow-red fatty cut 
surfaces with no gross masses or areas of abnormality. The tissue is entirely submitted in C1C3. 

Part D is designated 'right breast anterior lateral'. It consists of two unoriented yellow-red fatty 
tissue fragments together weighing 6.6 grams. The fragments measure 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and 
5.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm. Each has a slightly coarse flat assumed old margin and the opposite lobulated 
assumed new margin is inked blue. Each fragment is serially sectioned revealing uniform soft 
yellow-red fibrofatty cut surfaces with no gross lesions or areas of induration. The specimen is 
entirely submitted in D1-D5. 
Part E is designated 'right anterior margin'. It consists of a tissue fragment weighing 3.3 grams 
and consists of an elliptical skin fragment measuring 5 x 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm everted nipple 
centrally though at one edge. The skin is the new margin and the opposite old/deep margin is 
inked black. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing uniform rubbery tan-white cut surfaces. 
The tissue is entirely submitted in E1-E3.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR)
receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone
1E2 for PR from Ventana) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity.  Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on
manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells.
Results are as follows:
Block A1

Antibody  Result    Comment
ERsq 100 % Positive
PRsq 100 % Positive

 Infiltrating carcinoma cells are 3+ positive for both estrogen and
progesterone receptor assay.
Interpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY] M.D.
Comment:

Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1%
positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly
improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant
hormonal therapy.  Based on this information, tumors showing greater
than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered
positive.

<ADDENDUM> #1

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR)
receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone
1E2 for PR from Ventana) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity.  Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on
manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells.
Results are as follows:
Block B9

Antibody  Result    Comment
ERsq 100 % of tumor cells positive,            strong nuclear staining.

PRsq 20 % of tumor cells positive,             moderate nuclear staining

Interpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M YYY] M.D.
Comment:

Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1%
positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly
improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant
hormonal therapy.  Based on this information, tumors showing greater
than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered
positive.

ADDENDUM #2:

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for detection of the HER2 oncogene product
(using **INSTITUTION. Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal
antibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2
immunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP
in 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:
Block B9

Antibody  Result    Comment
HER2 2 +  Equivocal for overexpression

Impression:In-situ hybridization for HER-2 neu will be performed and the
results will be reported in an addendum.
Interpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M YYY] M.D.
Comment:

1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A
score of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane
staining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is
defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak
in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least
10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense completemembrane staining
but in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2
test) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any
proportion of tumor cells.
2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by
immunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as
negative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low
level HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of
cases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the
vast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene
amplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene
amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be
considered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive
testing for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all
cases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by
immunohistochemistry.   Performed at CellNetix Pathology  **PLACE, WA.  **ZIP-CODE.

FLUORESCENCE IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) STUDIES:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER-2/neu gene
amplification (using PathVysion probes and the MetaSystems Metafer
automated scanning fluorescent microscope) is performed at CellNetix,
**PLACE, WA. **ZIP-CODE. Results are as follows:
Block B9

Name **NAME[CCC]     Result
HER2 FISH 4.9
CEP-17    4.7
Tiles Used     202
HER2 FISH Estimated Ratio     1    Negative for Amplification

Interpretation:

Comment:There are numerous copies of the HER2 gene and CEP-17 in this
case that are a result of aneusomy of chromosome 17 (the ratio of HER2
to CEP-17 is <1.8 and the number of CEP-17 signals per nucleus is >2.5).
Using CAP-ASCO guidelines (1) for assessing HER2 without an internal
reference gene, this case would be considered ""equivocal"" for HER2 gene
amplification ( 4-6 HER2 copies per non-overlapping nucleus). Aneusomy
of chromosome 17 is not uncommon, can occur in up to 29.6% of patients
(2) and can result in overexpression of HER2 protein. Response to
trastuzumab in this cohort of patients has not been well studied (3).

tissue-based methods.JAMA. **ID-NUM, 2004

According to the CAP/ASCO guidelines, amplification is defined as a
signal ratio greater than 2.2 (JCO 25:1-28, 2007).  The results of this
test are meant to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic indicators.

<HISTOLOGY COMMENT>



<GROSS>
In formalin labeled ""left breast mass"" is a 5.0 x 6.2 x 3.2 cm oriented yellow-white fibrofatty piece of tissue. There are two sutures present designated as follows: Short suture - 12 o'clock; long suture - 9 o'clock. There is also a metal guide wire coursing through the anterior aspect to the medial-posterior aspect. The margins are inked as follows: 12 o'clock (superior) - orange; 3 o'clock (lateral) - green; 6 o'clock (inferior) - magenta; 9 o'clock (medial) - blue; anterior - yellow; posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing an ill-defined dark red-brown area that covers the majority of the specimen. There is also a 6 x 7 x 7 mm possible traumatic biopsy cavity filled with hard white structures consistent with calculi, ranging from 2-5 mm in greatest dimension. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted sequentially as follows: A1  A2 - horizontal sections of lateral margin; A3  A4 - bisected cross-section (A3 anterior, A4 posterior); A5-A7 - trisected cross-section (A5 anterior, A6 mid, A7 posterior); A8  A9 - bisected cross-section (A8 anterior with possible traumatic biopsy cavity and calculi; A9 - posterior); A10  A11 - bisected cross-section (A10 anterior with possible calculi; A11 posterior); A12  A13 - bisected cross-section (A12 anterior, A13 posterior); A14  A15 - representative horizontal sections of medial margin. as


<COMMENT>
The pattern of the ductal carcinoma-in-situ is mixed, in areas showing a classic solid pattern, admixed with a pattern which is best termed columnar cell or flat epithelial atypia type. Immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6 performed on a representative tissue block supports the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma-in-situ in this specimen (see immunohistochemistry).

maximal dimension. Both specimens are inked and the larger fragment is
bisected. The tissue is entirely submitted in one cassette.  (ke/nd)

<MICROSCOPIC>
Unless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen
is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate
controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific
fluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or
all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based
method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin
free multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the
table below:

The immunohistochemical tests reported were developed and performance
characteristics determined by CellNetix Labs, LLC.  Some tests have not
been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The
FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.
These tests may be used for clinical purposes.  They should not be
regarded as investigational or for research use only.  CellNetix Labs,
LLC is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR)
receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone
1E2 for PR from Ventana) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity.  Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on
manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells.
Results are as follows:
Block A1

Antibody  Result    Comment
ERsq 95 % of tumor cells positive,            strong nuclear staining.
Non-neoplastic internal control present (positive internal control).

PRsq 50 % of tumor cells positive,            strong nuclear staining.
Non-neoplastic internal control present (positive internal control).

Interpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY] MD
Comment:

Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1%
positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly
improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant
hormonal therapy.  Based on this information, tumors showing greater
than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered
positive.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for detection of the HER2 oncogene product
(using **INSTITUTION. Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal
antibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2

in 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:

HER2 3 +  Positive for overexpression

Impression:
Interpreted by:  **NAME[XXX M WWW] M.D.
Comment:

1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A
score of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane
staining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is
defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak
in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least
10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining
but in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2
test) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any
proportion of tumor cells.
2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by
immunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as
negative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low
level HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of
cases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the
vast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene
amplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene
amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be
considered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive
testing for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all
cases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by
immunohistochemistry.   Performed at CellNetix Pathology  **PLACE, WA.  **ZIP-CODE.

 intraductal tumor cells strongly express E-cadherin, compatible with
 a ductal carcinoma in situ. Focal areas lack myoepithelial cells,

NONE
DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:
The clinical impression of a possible satellite nodule is noted. Sampling of the presumed area shows marked lymphocytic lobulitis. Although it is of some interest that the in-situ and the invasive carcinoma are accompanied by marked lymphocytic infiltrate, the lobules in the presumed area of satellite nodule do not exhibit convincing cytomorphologic or histoarchitectural features of carcinoma (or atypical ductal hyperplasia), although some reactive changes are appreciated. 

The larger positive node was extensively sampled to evaluate for extranodal extension. It is extensively replaced by carcinoma which for the most part appears surrounded by dense fibrosis In one area (A20), this fibrosis is much more abundant, appears eccentric, contains a nest of carcinoma, as well as possible entrapped adipocytes; these features are interpreted as extranodal extension.

Breast, biopsy (core/incisional)/ RIGHT BREAST CORES 12 O'CLOCK- A
INTERPRETATION:


Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER-2/neu gene amplification has been performed per Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] request. The invasive carcinoma of RIGHT BREAST is reported to show a HER-2/neu to CEP-17 ratio of 3.55, which is interpreted as POSITIVE for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH.

Please see the separate report from the Dynacare Cytogenetics laboratory report ***PATH-NUMBER[1] (LCLS: **ID-NUM).
INTERPRETATION:


Immunohistochemistry studies for ER/PR receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone 1E2 for PR from Ventana) and for detection of the C-erb B-2 (Her2/Neu) oncogene product (using FDA-approved DAKO HercepTest) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue sections (A1). Routine histologic examination of the RIGHT BREAST demonstrates invasive carcinoma. Positive and negative controls show appropriate reactivity. 
Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells, and interpretation of HercepTest for Her2/neu is by following guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP in 2007 (see comment below). A positive internal control is identified. 
Results are as follows: 

ER:  Negative (0% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining), invasive carcinoma.
PR:  Negative (0% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining), invasive carcinoma.
c-erb B-2: Equivocal (score of 2-3) for overexpression of c-erb B-2 (Her2/Neu) protein, invasive carcinoma.

PENDING FISH HER2/NEU STUDIES, to be reported in an addendum report.

STUDY REQUESTED BY: Dr. **NAME[YYY M. ZZZ] 

COMMENT: 
Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1% positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant hormonal therapy. Based on this information, tumors showing greater than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered positive.
The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows: A score of 3+ (positive Her2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane staining in >30% of tumor cells. A score of 2+ (equivocal Her2 test) is defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining but in only 30% or fewer tumor cells. A score of 0 or 1+ (negative Her2 test) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells.
The correlation of Her2/neu protein overexpression by the DAKO HercepTest and Her2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) is not 100%. Rare cases interpreted as negative (0 and 1+) for Her2/neu protein over-expression may demonstrate Her2/neu gene amplification by FISH. Approximately 10% of cases interpreted as 2+ show gene amplification by FISH, and the vast majority, but not all cases interpreted as 3+ show gene amplification by FISH. Therefore, testing for c-erb B-2 (Her2/neu) gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be considered if clinically warranted. Reflexive testing for Her2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all cases interpreted as 2+ on immunohistochemistry.

The immunohistochemical tests (for ER/PR) reported were developed and performance characteristics determined by Dynacare Laboratories, **PLACE Wa. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests may be used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research use only.

The needle biopsy of this tumor (GSH ***PATH-NUMBER[1]) was extensively evaluated at PhenoPath Laboratories, revealing a phenotype most compatible with a skin adnexal-type carcinoma in the breast. Review of the entire lesion, shows features which support that interpretation, demonstrating a malignancy with features suggestive of eccrine differentiation. This case will be returned to PhenoPath Laboratories in follow-up, and an addendum report will be issued when their study is complete.

Comment: Invasive carcinoma with marked electrocautery artifact is found in slide eleven representing the medial surgical margin. Here, the tumor measures 0.4 cm in dimension but involves the medial (red) painted margin and therefore may actually be larger if invasive carcinoma remains. Immunohistochemistry studies which support invasion include absence of staining for myoepithelial markers p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain.  ER, PR and Her-2 studies will be attempted on the invasive component. Ductal carcinoma in situ is found to some degree in all sections of the breast excision and is very close to several margins. Slides with immunohistochemistry of the invasive component reviewed by Dr. **NAME[YYY XXX]. I have discussed the findings with **NAME[WWW], Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]'s nurse on **DATE[May 12 12].
<IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS>
Deparaffinized tissue sections undergo optimized epitope retrieval prior to incubation with the appropriate antibody.  Visualization is provided by an immunoperoxidase technique.  Immunohistochemical staining is evaluated by visual examination of slides using a conventional light microscope.  The positive and negative control slides for each immunohistochemical test are reviewed and found to exhibit the appropriate staining pattern.  Results on the targeted cell population are as indicated in the table below.  
Tests performed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded block 11.
ANTIBODY TO (CLONE ): RESULT.
1. SMOOTH MUSCLE MYOSIN HC (SMMS-1)*: Negative staining around cell groups in question.
2. p63 (4A4)*: Negative staining around cell groups in question.

<CLINICAL INFO>
Excerpt from Dr. **NAME[ZZZ]'s operative note: The patient is a truly
pleasant **AGE[in 40s]-year-old woman with a history of left breast inflammatory
cancer for which she underwent systemic therapy with good response. She
has stage IV disease. Because of the good control on systemic therapy,
mastectomy is indicated. She presents for mastectomy and lymph node
surgery.

<GROSS>
Collection date: **DATE[Mar 09 2012], placed in formalin at 11:00 p.m. Total
fixation time: Approximately 14 hours.
A.  Received in formalin, labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M]"", and
designated ""left breast including level 1 lymph node"", is a 924 gram
left breast with axilla. It has dimensions as follows: 20 cm medial to
lateral, 22 cm superior to inferior, 7 cm superficial to deep. There is
a 16 x 7.5 cm ellipse of skin with a normal nipple. There is a 0.6 x 0.6
x 0.1 cm tan-brown, slightly raised lesion, 0.2 cm from the inferior
skin margin. It is inked as follows: superior superficial - orange,
inferior superficial - blue, deep - black. It is sectioned from medial
to lateral into twenty-three slices, numbered respectively. The nipple
is in slice 9. There is an 8 x 5 x 4 cm tan-white, firm, nodular area in
slices 9-14, with a metal clip in inferior slice 9, consistent with a
previous biopsy site. There are a few additional focal areas of
hemorrhage. No other discrete mass or lesion is identified. The
remaining tissue consists of yellow, lobulated adipose tissue (95%)
intermixed with firm, white, nodular fibrous tissue (5%). Representative
sections are submitted as follows: A1- nipple; A2- superior, mid and
inferior slice 5 with attached superior superficial, deep and inferior
superficial margins, respectively; A3- mid slice 8, tissue adjacent to
firm area with detached deep margin; A4- inferior slice 8, tissue
adjacent to firm area with metal clip, with detached inferior
superficial margin; A5- firm area in superior slice 9 with detached
superior superficial margin; A6- firm tissue with metal clip in inferior
slice 9 with attached inferior superficial margin; A7- firm area in mid
slice 10 with detached deep margin; A8- firm area in inferior slice 10,
adjacent to metal clip with detached inferior superficial margin; A9-
firm area in inferior slice 11 with attached skin and inferior
superficial margin; A10- firm area in superior slice 12 with attached
superior superficial margin; A11- firm area in superior slice 13 with
detached superior superficial margin; A12- firm area in superior slice
14 with attached superior superficial margin; A13- superior, mid and
inferior slice 15 with attached superior superficial, deep and inferior
superficial margins, respectively; A14- superior, mid and inferior slice
18 with attached superior superficial, deep and inferior superficial
margins, respectively; A15- superior, mid and inferior slice 21 with
attached superior superficial, deep and inferior superficial margins,
respectively; A16- three possible lymph nodes; A17- six possible lymph
nodes; A18- two possible lymph nodes, differentially inked and bisected;
A19- one possible lymph node trisected.

B.  Received in formalin, labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M]"", and
designated ""level 2 nodes"", is a 5 x 4.8 x 2.3 cm portion of adipose
tissue containing five possible lymph nodes, 0.2-1.2 cm in greatest
dimension. The tissue is entirely submitted as follows: B1- five
possible lymph nodes; B2- remaining adipose tissue. (axp/cm)

<MICROSCOPIC>
Unless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen
is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate
controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific
fluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or
all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based
method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin
free multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the
table below:
Block A9

Antibody  Result    Comment
SMM  Focally positive
D2-40     Indeterminate
Pan CK    Positive

Impression:  Smooth muscle myosin stain demonstrates positive staining
around DCIS in block A9 and negative staining around invasive tumor
cells. Pan-cytokeratin highlights the carcinoma cells including few
clusters within lymphatic channels. D2-40 stain shows nonspecific
staining and does not appear to stain lymphatic endothelium
appropriately and therefore is non-contributory.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for detection of the HER2 oncogene product
(using **INSTITUTION. Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal
antibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show

in 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:
Block A1

Antibody  Result    Comment
HER2 1+   Negative for overexpression

Impression:
Interpreted by:  **NAME[VVV M. UUU] MD
Comment:

1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A
score of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane
staining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is
defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak
in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least
10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining
but in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2
test) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any
proportion of tumor cells.
2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by
immunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as
negative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low
level HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of
cases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the
vast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene
amplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene
amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be
considered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive
testing for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all
cases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by
immunohistochemistry.   Performed at CellNetix Pathology  **PLACE, WA.  **ZIP-CODE.

Left breast cancer.  Right breast MRI abnormality.

<GROSS>
Received in formalin are three specimens each labeled with the patient's name.
A.  The specimen designated 'right subareolar (long lateral, short superior),' is an oriented fibrofatty tissue fragment weighing 7 gm and measuring 5.3 cm from medial to lateral, 2.3 cm from anterior to posterior, and 1.2 cm from superior to inferior.  The tail-end of the localization guidewire extends from the lateral aspect.  With the provided orientation, the specimen is differentially inked to allow for microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  superior-blue, inferior-green, posterior-black, anterior-yellow, medial-purple, lateral-orange.  The tissue is serially sectioned from medial toward lateral into nine slices with the hooked end of the guidewire terminating in slice 8.  Sectioning reveals uniform rubbery fibrofatty cut surfaces throughout with a hemorrhagic cavity in slices 4-6.  There is no discrete mass identified.  The specimen is entirely submitted sequentially in cassettes A1-A6.  
B.  The specimen designated 'left breast, stitch superior,' consists of an unoriented breast specimen weighing 765 gm and measuring 23 cm from superior to inferior, 21 cm from medial to lateral and up to 5.3 cm from superficial to deep.  There is an overlying 15.5 x 7 cm horizontal tan-pink skin ellipse, with a central to slightly medial 3.5 x 3.3 cm everted nipple and areolar complex, grossly without ulceration.  At 12:00, 2 cm from the nipple, there is a 0.7 cm tan-brown lesion with similar lesions from 0.4-0.8 cm are identified at 5:00, 3 cm from the nipple, 7:00, 2 cm from the nipple, and 11:00, 2.5 cm from the nipple.  The specimen is inked as follows:  superior/superficial   blue, inferior/superficial   green, and posterior   black.  
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial towards lateral into 19 slices, with the nipple aligned between slices 7-8.  Sectioning reveals an indurated tan-white mass in the upper-outer quadrant, grossly approximately 2:00, 3-4 cm from the nipple.  This mass occupies slices 8-10, and measures 2.3 cm from superior to inferior, 1.3 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.6 cm from medial to lateral.  Centrally within the mass, there is gel-foam filler, consistent with a previous biopsy site.  The mass is 3 cm from the nearest superior margin, 3.5 cm from the deep margin, and 5 cm from the inferior margin.  This discrete mass is surrounded superiorly and inferiorly, as well as anterior/medially, by rubbery to dense irregular fibrocystic tissue, which occupies slices 6-10.  The greatest extent of this irregular tissue, including mass is 7.3 cm from superior to inferior, 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior, and 4 cm from medial to lateral.  The remainder of the breast shows soft tan-yellow lobulated fatty cut surfaces, with a minimal to moderate fibrous component.  There are no additional discrete masses, lesions or areas of induration identified.  Palpation and dissection of the most lateral slices reveals no additional attached axillary nodes.  
Sections are submitted as follows:  B1 representative section of central nipple, section of described lesions, random section of skin, B2 central breast, slice 5, fibrocystic tissue lateral to field of described irregular tissue (no margins shown), B3 slice 6, retroareolar tissue, at medial extent of irregularity, B4 slice 7, tissue medially adjacent to discrete mass, B5-B8, slice 7, sections submitted sequentially from superior toward inferior showing greatest extent of mass with surrounding irregular tissue (no margins shown), B9 slice 7, superior margin, adjacent to tissue in B5, B10 slice 7, deep margin nearest to mass, B11 slice 7 inferior margin nearest to tissue in B8, B12 slice 9, mass in this slice with inferiorly adjacent fibrous tissue, B13 slice 10, lateral extent of mass, B14 slice 11, tissue laterally adjacent to mass, B15 upper-outer quadrant, B16 lower-outer quadrant, B17 lower-inner quadrant, B18 upper-inner quadrant.
C.  The specimen designated 'axillary contents, left' is an 8.5 x 8.5 x 1.5 cm portion of soft rubbery tan-yellow fatty tissue.  Palpation and dissection of this tissue reveals 16 soft and rubbery tan-pink probable lymph nodes ranging from 0.5-2.4 cm in maximum dimension.  The nodes are entirely submitted as follows:  C1 two nodes bisected (one inked blue), C2 six nodes intact, C3 one node trisected, C4 one node bisected, C5 one node bisected, C6 one node bisected, C7 two nodes intact, C8 one node bisected, C9-C10 one node sectioned.

BREAST MARKER STUDIES BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
ER, PR and HER2 assessment by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are performed in this laboratory in accordance with guidelines issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-ASCP) (Wolff et al., J Clin Oncol 2007;**ID-NUM; **PLACE et al. J Clin Oncol 2010;**ID-NUM).
All specimens are fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.  See gross description for cold ischemic time and fixation time for the specimen.  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections are deparaffinized and incubated with the following validated antibodies: Biocare medical clone SP1, a rabbit monoclonal anti-ER antibody; Dako clone PgR 636, a mouse monoclonal anti-PR antibody; and Dako polyclonal antibody Cerb A0485, a rabbit polyclonal anti-HER2 antibody.  Detection:  a highly sensitive, biotin-free, polymer-based immunoperoxidase technique is employed according to an optimized protocol (Envision Plus HRP, Dako).  Controls:  for ER, PR and HER2, external controls are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative immunoreactivity and fount to be satisfactory.
Scoring results:  For ER and PR, a cutoff of 1% positive tumor cells, as determined by semiquantitative assessment, is employed for determination of assay results.  For HER2, results are scored as follows:  Negative for overexpression:  no membrane staining (0) or weak/incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells (1+); Equivocal for protein expression: complete membrane staining that, either nonuniform or weak in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of tumor cells, or intense, complete membrane staining of 30% or fewer tumor cells (2+).
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for the HER2 gene is performed on all of these cases scored as 2+.  Positive for protein expression:  uniform intense membrane staining of >30% of invasive tumor cells (3+).
Quality assurance:  **INSTITUTION Department of Pathology has in place quality assurance programs for ER, PR and HER2, in accordance with ASCO-CAP guidelines.  This includes case review by Pathologists dedicated to interpreting these marker studies and ongoing concordance studies within the Virginia Mason Laboratory as well as external validation with a reference laboratory (**PLACE, WA).

   Please see also the previous breast biopsy and lumpectomy reports (11S-2634 and 11S-3056)

          













   .

   The staging is an attempt to combine the information from the lumpectomy and the mastectomy

   specimens. The exact size of the various carcinomas is difficult to determine because of

   their diffuse and multifocal distribution, but the stage is based on a maximum dimension of

   1.7 cm read off the histologic slides(s)..  The previous lumpectomy specimen (11S-3056) had

   one positive sentinel lymph node, and 1 out of 3 positive axillary lymph nodes (total 2/4).

   This mastectomy specimen has 4 lymph nodes, all negative for carcinoma (even on pankeratin

   immunostain, there was a small suspicious focus that proved negative on immunostain) (0/4).

   Total lymph node count for this patient is **AGE[birth-12] out of 8 lymph nodes positive for carcinoma

  (2/8), which is pN1a.  Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] was telephoned with a brief discussion of the findings on **DATE[Oct 15 11].





   The left simple mastectomy specimen measures 17 cm superior to inferior, 19 cm medial to

   lateral, and up to 3.5 cm thick centrally.  The inferior half of the superficial surface is

   covered by a 17 x 8 cm skin ellipse with a central 3.5 cm areola and normal 1 cm nipple.

   1.5 cm superior medial from the nipple there is an oblique longitudinal partially healed

   scar 3 cm long running from approximately 9:30 to the 12 o'clock position at the edge of the

   areola.  The superior superficial surgical margin is grossly unremarkable fat and extends up

   to 9 cm superior to the superior edge of the ellipse.  The inferior surgical margin is

   unremarkable fat.  The deep surface is a transected fascial plane with bits of attached

   skeletal muscle.  The superior superficial margin is inked blue, inferior superficial margin

   green and the deep surface black.  Bread loafing reveals a 5 cm seroma  lined by pink tan

   granulation tissue in the central and medial portions of the breast directly underneath the

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for estrogen and progesterone (ER/PR)
receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone
1E2 for PR from Ventana) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity.  Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on
manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells.
Results are as follows:
Block A1

Antibody  Result    Comment
ERsq 98 % of tumor cells positive,            strong nuclear staining.

PRsq 95 % of tumor cells positive,            strong nuclear staining.

Interpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M YYY] M.D.
Comment:

Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1%
positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly
improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant
hormonal therapy.  Based on this information, tumors showing greater
than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered
positive.

METHODOLOGY
HER2 FISH testing is performed according to ASCO-CAP guidelines (Wolff AC et
al., J Clin Oncol 25:**PHONE). Methods: Deparaffinized sections of tissue,
following pretreatment, are incubated with PathVysion    HER2 probe kit (**NAME[ZZZ]
**PLACE, IL) containing 2 separate probes: a locus-specific HER2
gene probe (17p11.2-q12 ) and a reference chromosome 17 centromere probe
(CEP17; 17p11.1-q11.1). Morphometric image analysis is performed using a
MetaSystems    platform and Metafer 4    application software. The HER2 and CEP17
signals are counted per tile/nucleus and the HER2:CEP17 ratio is calculated.
FISH Scoring: Results are scored as positive (HER2:CEP17 ratio > 2.2),
negative (HER2:CEP17 ratio <1.8), or equivocal for amplification (HER2:CEP17
ratio     1.8 and     2.2). Test Validation: The test methodology employed in this
laboratory has demonstrated an extremely high concordance rate between IHC
and FISH (Gown AM et al., Mod Pathol **ID-NUM, 2008; Yaziji H et al., JAMA
**ID-NUM, 2004). In the most recent study of 6604 patients, a 99.2%
concordance was demonstrated between negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC and
non-amplified HER2 FISH, and a 94.7% concordance was demonstrated between
positive (3+) HER2 IHC and amplified HER2 FISH. Quality Assurance: PhenoPath
Laboratories has in place a quality assurance program for HER2 FISH, which
includes daily controls (cell lines and tissues), Levy-Jennings analysis of
HER2 controls, and ongoing concordance studies between IHC and FISH, to ensure
high levels of interobserver and methodology concordance. (*PhenoPath
Laboratories' HER2 validation and ongoing monitoring of IHC and FISH assays
demonstrate extremely high concordance (>95%) that is independent of the
reported duration of fixation.)

  A) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""right
breast, lump SS LL"" is a 38 gram, 6.2 x 5.0 x 2.3 cm portion of fatty
breast tissues with sutures marking: short-superior, long-lateral. A
localization wire exits toward medial-superior. A radiograph is viewed in
EPIC and shows a dense process with biopsy clip in place, all in relation
to the needle localization wire. The specimen is inked: superior-blue,
inferior-green, anterior-purple, deep-black, lateral-yellow, medial-orange. 
The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial to demonstrate a
2.6 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm pink indurated lesion with biopsy clip in place. This
approaches the superior-anterior margin, is 0.4 cm from deep, is 1.5 cm
from inferior, is within 0.4 cm of lateral, and approximately 4.0 cm from
medial. This lesion demonstrates lateral fat necrosis and hemorrhage. No
additional mass lesions are identified and the cut surfaces are yellow
glistening lobulated adipose tissue with minimal areas of membranous
parenchymous septae. 
Representative sections are submitted sequentially from lateral to medial

<MICROSCOPIC>
  A) Sections through the breast confirm the presence of an infiltrating
ductal carcinoma. Microscopic evaluation shows that the gross estimation
of the maximal tumor size is an over-estimate. Most of what was noted
grossly consists of a tract of scar and reactive changes from the previous
biopsy. Only a small amount of residual invasive and in situ carcinoma is
noted. This is best seen on slide A2. The residual focus of invasive tumor
spans an area of 2.0 mm. On the original biopsy sample (**ID-NUMS) tumor
spans an area of at least 4.0 mm. This biopsy measurement will be used for
staging purposes. Nests of invasive tumor come to within 0.6 cm of the
lateral margin with other margins being widely clear. The tissue that was
noted approaching the superior anterior margin on gross evaluation is a
tract of scar and fibrous tissues from the biopsy and does not represent
neoplasia near this margin. There are surrounding breast ducts with
fibrocystic changes including cysts, columnar cell change and stromal
fibrosis. Other findings are as listed in the diagnosis section of this
report. 
B,C) Sections from each sentinel lymph node are benign. No metastatic
carcinoma is identified. Multiple levels have been cut according to the

Additional findings:
Immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone receptor
expression and Her-2/neu overexpression have been performed on a prior
biopsy (Group Health #**ID-NUM) with the following results: ER positive
(**NAME[ZZZ] score 8), PR positive (**NAME[ZZZ] 6-7), HER-2/neu negative for
amplification (FISH). The immunohistochemistry results are by report
only (not reviewed).
Additional immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone
receptor expression was performed on the smaller lesion (0.5 cm, ductal
NOS) with the following results:  ER 100% tumor cells positive, PR 100%
tumor cells positive.  Immunohistochemistry for Her-2/neu is pending and
the results will be reported in an addendum.

<COMMENT>
The excision contains two morphologically discrete foci of infiltrating
carcinoma.  One focus (1.3 cm) is associated with the prior biopsy site
and shows morphologic features of micropapillary carcinoma. The second
focus (0.4 cm) is located more laterally within the specimen, closely
associated with low grade in-situ carcinoma, and shows morphologic
features most closely resembling ductal carcinoma, NOS.  Although both
foci show a similar ER/PR expression profile, the distinct morphologic
profiles favors two separate primaries over intramammary spread.

The micropapillary carcinoma shows multifocal lymphatic involvement.
The invasive carcinoma that is close to the anterior and superior
margins is micropapillary type and appears to be related to lymphatic
spread.

receptors (using rabbit monoclonal antibodies clone SP1 for ER and clone
1E2 for PR from Ventana) are carried out on formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity.  Determination of ER/PR reactivity is based on
manual estimation of the percentage of positive nuclei in tumor cells.
Results are as follows:

Interpreted by:  **NAME[YYY M XXX] M.D.
Comment:

Some immunohistochemistry studies have suggested that as few as 1%
positive tumor cells for ER/PR may correlate with a significantly
improved clinical response of patients to therapeutic and adjuvant
hormonal therapy.  Based on this information, tumors showing greater
than 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining for ER/PR may be considered
positive.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Immunohistochemistry studies for detection of the HER2 oncogene product
(using **INSTITUTION. Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal
antibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show
appropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2
immunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP
in 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:
Block D3

Antibody  Result    Comment
HER2 0    Negative for overexpression

Impression:
Interpreted by:  **NAME[YYY M XXX] M.D.
Comment:

1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A
score of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane
staining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is
defined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak
in intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least
10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining
but in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2
test) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any
proportion of tumor cells.
2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by
immunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as
negative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low
level HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of
cases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the
vast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene
amplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene
amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be
considered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive
testing for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all
cases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by
immunohistochemistry.   Performed at CellNetix Pathology  **PLACE, WA.  **ZIP-CODE.

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and ""right breast and axillary contents"" is an 864 gram mastectomy specimen. There is a clip present on the edge of the overlying skin designated superior margin. The specimen measures 24.0 cm from medial to lateral, 19.0 cm from superior to inferior and 5.5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is overlying tan-pink skin measuring 22.5 x 11.5 cm. Centrally located is a nipple, which is located between slice 9 and 10 of the breast tissue, measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Centrally located on the nipple is a light tan friable area measuring 0.5 x 0.2 cm. 3.0 cm from the nipple at 8:00 is a 0.6 cm in greatest dimension red area. 8.0 cm from the nipple at 10:00 is a 3.5 cm in greatest dimension tan-pink depression, possible scar. This is present towards the lateral margin, upper outer quadrant. Specimen is inked as follows: superior superficial blue, inferior superficial green, and deep surface black. The axilla is unlinked. The specimen is cross sectioned from medial to lateral into seventeen slices.
 Sectioning reveals a light tan to pink ill-defined fibrous area with retracted adipose tissue surrounding it, in slice 13 and measures up to 3.0 x 1.5 x approximately 3.5 cm. This area abuts the depression on the upper outer quadrant of the skin. It also abuts the deep margin (black ink), is 4.5 cm from the superior tip, 7.5 cm from the inferior tip. 
Sectioning and palpation through the axillary tissue reveals a 4.2 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm firm nodule which is approximately 1.0 cm from the first described area of interest. Sectioning through the nodule reveals tan pink firm cut surface. Further palpation reveals no lymph nodes grossly identified.
 Sectioning through the remaining tissue reveals yellow adipose tissue with minimal ill-defined tan-pink fibrous tissue. Representative sections in nine cassettes.

PATIENT: **NAME[AAA BBB]


<GROSS>
The core biopsies are evaluated for adequacy using touch preparations on site in the CT Department by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY].  One specimen is received in a container of formalin labeled **NAME[BBB, AAA] F.  The specimen is designated ""right upper lobe"" per the accompanying requisition and consists of multiple irregular needle core fragments and needle cores of gray-pale red soft tissue measuring less than 0.1 cm up to 0.6 x 0.1 cm.  This is filtered through a fine mesh and submitted in one cassette.  Also received are four fixed and stained slides prepared at the time of biopsy.  (**INITIALS **DATE[Jun 19 12])


<MICROSCOPIC>
The biopsies include alveolar lung tissue and fragments of a malignant epithelial neoplasm with sheet-like growth pattern.  Immunohistochemical evaluation is undertaken with the following results:

p63                 4A4, Dako           M Mono    Positive
Using an automated stainer, sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded- tissue are incubated with the designated antibody which is then localized by a non-biotin, dual polymer detection system. The case is reviewed and interpreted in the context of appropriate internal and external controls.  These tests have been optimized and validated for use at Northwest Pathology.
ER/PR: Antibodies directed toward estrogen receptor (SP1, Biocare) and progesterone receptor (1AG, Vector) are applied to the test tissue along with appropriate controls. The tumor is scored in a manner that reflects the percentage of cells staining and the level of intensity.
The immunohistochemical findings are most compatible with squamous carcinoma, likely of lung origin.

Left breast cancer.

<GROSS>
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and without a specimen source designation is an oriented modified left radical mastectomy consisting of the axillary tail measuring 15.0 x 13.3 x 3.3 cm and the left breast weighing 1,046.0 gm and measuring 26.7 cm medial to lateral, 21.5 cm superior to inferior, and up to 4.2 cm anterior to posterior.  The specimen has been received oriented per the surgeon with a short suture designating the superior resection margin and a long suture designating the lateral resection margin.  The overlying ellipse of lightly pigmented skin is 26.7 cm medial to lateral x 16.2 cm superior to inferior.  The nipple-areolar complex is 9.0 cm in diameter.  The everted nipple is 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  The skin surface is remarkable for a 7.0 cm in length x 0.1 cm in average diameter well-healed surgical scar involving the upper outer quadrant.  Additional skin masses or lesions are not grossly identified.  The specimen is differentially inked in order to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins in the following manner:  superior-anterior blue, inferior-anterior green, and posterior black.  Sectioning of the mastectomy reveals a 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass within the upper outer quadrant.  This mass comes to within 2.0 cm of the overlying skin, 4.0 cm of the posterior resection margin, 4.0 cm of the nearest superior-anterior resection margin, and 9.0 cm from the nearest inferior-anterior resection margin.  Present within the central aspect of the mass is a metallic clip.  Additional distinct breast masses, lesions or prior biopsy sites are not grossly identified.  The remainder of the mastectomy grossly appears to be comprised of approximately 75% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 25% white to pink fibrous tissue.  Dissection of the axillary tail reveals fifteen lymph node candidates ranging in greatest dimension from 0.6 cm to 3.0 cm.  The largest lymph node candidate which represents the highest lymph node within the axillary tail has a cut surface which is remarkable for a white to gray gritty cut surface as well as hemorrhage and necrosis.  This lymph node grossly appears to have been previously biopsied.  The identified lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety.  SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:  A1 nipple, A2 skin scar found on upper outer quadrant, A3-A6 mass from upper outer quadrant, A7 mass from upper outer quadrant with overlying skin, A8 superior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A9 inferior-anterior resection margin of breast mass, A10 posterior resection margin of breast mass, A11 uninvolved breast tissue from upper inner quadrant, A12 uninvolved breast tissue from lower inner quadrant, A13 uninvolved breast tissue from lower outer quadrant, A14 uninvolved breast tissue from upper outer quadrant, A15 six intact lymph nodes, A16 six intact lymph nodes, A17 one lymph node bisected, A18-A19 largest and highest lymph node within axillary tail serially sectioned.

H&E-stained sections examined.  Slide A18 shows an involved lymph node, 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Tumor is identified outside of the lymph node capsule.  This may represent extracapsular lymph node extension, tumor tracking along the previous biopsy site, or direct tumor extension into the lymph node. 
This case has undergone prospective intradepartmental quality assurance review prior to verification.

The tumor cells are found in association with acute inflammation and background fibrosis.  No granulomas or necrosis is seen.  Focal benign cartilage and focal benign respiratory mucosa are present.  The Diff-Quik touch prep stains demonstrate numerous large abnormal cells with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In the background, there are numerous macrophages, neutrophils and fewer small lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains were conducted.  The tumor labels with cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 (focal), p63 (rare), cytokeratin 5/6 (rare, weak), and TTF-1.  The tumor does not label with CDX2 or PSA (positive controls intact).

DiagnosisComment:
While this is favored to be a primary neoplasm in the colon, the possibility of this lesion representing metastasis is not entirely ruled out.  The tumor in the current biopsy does not resemble the well differentiation pulmonary adenocarcinoma that was seen in the lung in prior cases ***PATH-NUMBER[1] and ***PATH-NUMBER[2].  Clinical correlation is suggested.

The focally inflamed and necrotic diverticulum that is favored to be responsible for the perforation is not associated with the tumor.

Immunohistochemistry stains show positive tumor staining for synaptophysin, CD56, TTF-1 and CK7.  Stains are negative for CK20 and CDX2.  PCK stain shows weak and patchy staining.  

Stains of nodal tissue show staining for synaptophysin, with surrounding lymphoid cells staining for LCA.

The following results were performed at Clarient Diagnostic Services, Aliso Viejo, CA, and reported by **NAME[YYY XXX], M.D., on **DATE[Aug 22 2011].


Comment:  ALK rearrangement was not detected using the ALK dual color, break-apart rearrangement assay from **INSTITUTION 
    (**NAME[WWW] Molecular).  The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggest that the patient may not respond to ALK 
    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested.

    Reference range:
    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater 
    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.
    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times 
    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.

    Methodology:
    After deferring the tumor area on an H\T\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient 
    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay 
    (**NAME[WWW] Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe 
    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping 
    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals 
    were recorded and interpreted.

    Intended Use:
    The LSI ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is 
    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene.  Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-
    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  
    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung adenocarcinoma.  Patient s who harbor this mutation may 
    respond to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[Sep 2007]).  Identification of the transforming EMBL4-ALK

DiagnosisComment:
Immunostains will be peformed to determine the origin of this tumor.  The patient has a history of carcinoma of the breast.

The tumor is CK7+/CK20-.  Stains for BRST-2 and mammaglobin are negative making a breast origin unlikely.  The patient had a DCIS in 2000 (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).  The tumor is also positive for MOC31 and CEA.  Stains for the following are negative   calretinin, TTF-1, CA125 and CA19-9.  This staining pattern is not definitive however it is consistent with a lung origin although the TTF-1 is negative.  An endocervical origin is also a possibility.

Lung biopsy, clinically left lower lobe mass:
  FAVOR NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA (SEE COMMENT)
DiagnosisComment:
Please see attached outside consultation report ***PATH-NUMBER[1] from Clarient.  The outside consultation diagnosis is NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA; POSSIBLY ADENOSQUAMOUS CARCINOMA.

The sections contain core biopsies of lung tissue.  Most of the core fragments are comprised of benign lung tissue, however, at the end of one core is a small focus of a CK7-positive epithelial proliferation which is favored to be non-small cell carcinoma.  The staining pattern present is not definitively specific for further characterization.  This case will be sent for pulmotype study to attempt to further characterize the process.  The findings will be reported in an addendum report.  

This case has been amended.  The initial diagnosis was ""focal atypical proliferation, favor non-small cell carcinoma"".  The amended diagnosis is ""favor non-small cell carcinoma"".

A\T\B.  The lung mass has an irregular contour involving the subpleural lung parenchyma with areas of deeper lung parenchymal extension without involvement of the visceral pleura with an elastic stain examined to delineate the pleura (block B7).  There are malignant glandular formations with many parts of the tumor particularly in part B with a partly bronchoalveolar pattern of growth with lepidic spread along thicken alveolar septae with other areas with a more fibrotic background and focally more irregular malignant gland formations and focal background anthracotic pigment .  The neoplasm expresses TTF-1 (done on blocks A5 and B7) consistent with a lung primary.  The tumor expresses cytokeratin 7 and appears negative for cytokeratin 20 (block B7) also consistent with a lung primary.  There are scattered emphysematous changes with subpleural larger emphysematous spaces and focal limited subpleural fibrosis.  The neoplasm is seen in part B adjoining the staple line of the initial wedge biopsy suggesting contiguous tumor from the wedge biopsy portion to the part B specimen.  The bronchial and vascular margins are without tumor with two lymph nodes identified (block B14) with anthracosis without metastasis.  Focal limited subpleural poorly expanded alveoli are seen (block B13). 

C-G.  These parts have focally anthracotic pigment in the lymph node tissue with reactive sinus histiocytes without metastasis.

Exon 19 deletionIncreased responsiveness to TKIsDeletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1).G719S, G719A, G719CIncreased responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 719 in exon 18 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy (slightly more than 50%), although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21. Reference (1)L858RIncreased responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L858R in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation or receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)L861QIncreased  responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L861Q in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)S768ILack of responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy. Reference (2)T790MLack of responsiveness to TKIsT790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs.  It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone. Reference (3)Exon 20 InsertionLack of responsiveness to TKIsInsertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations.  This is a rare mutation, however, and robust clinical data is lacking. Reference (2)References:(1)  **NAME[VVV, UUU M]. et al.  N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004.

Methodology:  Tumor areas of interest were identified, selectively microdissected from the paraffin-embedded tissue section.  The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample.  The DNA yield was determined, and the samples were brought to an optimal concentration.  Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene.  Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.  

Intended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis be real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI' s.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva).

Prognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or histopathological findings.

This assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by **INSTITUTION.  Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA  88, this laboratory has established the test s accuracy and precision.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as the FDA has determined that such approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

Comment:  ALK rearrangement was not detected using the ALK dual color, break-apart rearrangement assay from **INSTITUTION (**NAME[TTT] Molecular).  The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggests that the patient may not respond to ALK inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested.

Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 5  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.

    Methodology:  After determining the tumor area on an H\T\E slide from this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LSI ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay (**NAME[TTT] Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non?overlapping nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals were recorded and interpreted.

Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4   ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung adenocarcinoma.  Patients who harbor this mutation may respond to ALK inhibitors.

Other than being an adenocarcinoma, the morphologic features of the current case do not closely resemble those of the 2003 case, thus a second lung primary is a consideration.

Comment:  ALK rearrangement was not detected using the ALK dual color, break-apart rearrangement assay from **INSTITUTION 
    Abbot Molecular).  The absence of an ALK rearrangement suggests that the patient may not respond to ALK 
    inhibitors.  Clinical correlation is suggested. 

    Reference range:
    Not Detected:  Less than or equal to 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater 
    than 2 times signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.
    Detected:  Greater than 15% of cells with split signals (3  ALK and 45  ALK signals apart by greater than 2 times 
    signal size or single 3  ALK signal) in 50 cells scored.

    Methodology:
    After determining the tumor area on the H\T\E slide form this formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient 
    specimen, ALK gene rearrangement was assessed utilizing the LIS ALK Dual Color, Break Apart Probe assay 
    (Abbot Molecular).  The identification probes for LSI ALK 5  probe (SpectrumGreen) and LSI ALK 3  probe 
    (SpectrumOrange) were hybridized according to the manufacturer s guidelines.  At least 50 non-overlapping 
    nuclei were analyzed and the localization of the LSI ALK 5  probe (green) and LSI ALK 3  probe (orange) signals 
    were recorded and interpreted.

    Intended Use:
    The LSI ALK (anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) Dual Color, Break Apart Rearrangement Probe (Abbot Molecular) is 
    designed to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene Fusion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-
    associated protein-like 4 gene (EML4-ALK) can be detected in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  
    EML4-ALK fusion is observed primarily in lung adenocarcinoma.  Patients who harbor this mutation may respond 
    to ALK inhibitors.  Nature 448, 561-566 (2 **DATE[May 2008]).  Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion 
    gene in the non-small-cell lung cancer.

    Prognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or 
    histopathological findings.

    Some tests use Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR s).  The performance characteristics of these ASR s were 
    determined by Clarient.  They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
    (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  Clarient is certified under the

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Exon 19 deletionIncreased responsiveness to TKIsDeletions in exon 19 confer ligand independent activation and increase the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  These deletions result in the modified receptors being approximately 100-fold more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1).G719S, G719A, G719CIncreased responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 719 in exon 18 are associated with response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy (slightly more than 50%), although they are not as responsive as those with deletions in exon 19 or point mutations of codon 858 in exon 21. Reference (1)L858RIncreased responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L858R in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation or receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in the modified receptors being more sensitive than wild-type receptors to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)L861QIncreased  responsiveness to TKIsThe missense mutation L861Q in exon 21 confers ligand independent activation and increases the duration and activation of receptor signaling after ligand binding.  This mutation results in a modified receptor that has been reported to be more sensitive than wild-type receptor to inhibition with TKIs. Reference (1)S768ILack of responsiveness to TKIsMutations at codon 768 in exon 20 are associated with less responsiveness of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy. Reference (2)T790MLack of responsiveness to TKIsT790M point mutation in exon 20 is a frequent cause of secondary resistance to TKIs.  It appears that TKI administration may select for a pre-existing T790M resistance clone. Reference (3)Exon 20 InsertionLack of responsiveness to TKIsInsertions in exon 20 have been associated with lack of clinical response of NSCLC to gefitinib or erlotinib monotherapy both in vitro and in patients despite the fact that they seem to activate EGFR to a similar degree as deletions in exon 19 or exon 21 mutations.  This is a rare mutation, however, and robust clinical data is lacking. Reference (2)References:(1)  **NAME[VVV, UUU M]. et al.  N Engl J Med 350(21): 2129, 2004.

Methodology:  Tumor areas of interest were identified and selectively microdissected from the paraffin-embedded tissue section.  The collected cells were lysed, and the genomic DNA was purified from the sample.  Real-time PCR was used to evaluate specific mutations, deletions and insertions in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene.  Eight reactions containing 30 primer and probe sets were used to target specific regions of exons 18-21 as well as the wild-type sequence.  

Intended Use:  The EGFR mutation analysis be real-time PCR is able to detect the wild-type sequence and 29 known mutations, deletions and insertions found in exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  There is a significant association between EGFR mutation, especially exon 19 deletion, and response to TKI' s.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation of 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  These mutations are linked to clinical responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva)./r/n"

  The sample tested is negative for the L858R mutation in exon 21 and for
  deletion mutations in exon 19 of the EGFR gene, which together account for
  about 90% of the somatic mutations in the EGFR gene in patients with lung
  cancer. If clinically indicated, DNA sequence analysis can be performed
  separately to detect other rare mutations in the EGFR gene (EGFR Level 2
  test). This test can normally detect a heterozygous mutation when it is
  present in more than about 10% (for L858R) or 2% (for deletions) of the cells
  in the sample.

Lung, left lower lobe, biopsy: Positive for an exon 19 Deletion EGFR mutation
by real time PCR (see Comments).

<DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS>
In this case an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion
mutation was detected by Qiagen/DxS real time PCR. In non-small cell lung
cancer, this type of activating EGFR mutation is reported to correlate with
responsiveness to anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase therapy. This real time PCR assay
has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain
mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell
lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor
types is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to
diagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select
eligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok

EGFR by PCR 
EGFR PCR METHODS
This real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating
mutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell
cancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of
mutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not
distinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and
G719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20
insertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the
types). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR
mutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19
deletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this
assay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified
genomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by
low volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR
assay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type
and mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are
calculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant
reaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative
and positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is
estimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. 
METHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample
of tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same
tumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these
areas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay
produces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In
instances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to
the wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,
leading to a false-negative result.

<DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS>
In this case no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were
identified by Qiagen/DxS real time PCR. This real time PCR assay has been
validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations
that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated for non-small cell lung
carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of this assay in other tumor
types is not well characterized. Note that this assay is not intended to
diagnose any particular type of cancer, but as an aid to clinicians, is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors to select
eligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[ZZZ:YYY] et al., NEJM 2004;**ID-NUM, Mok

CLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY
EGFR by PCR. Lung adenocarcinoma
EGFR PCR METHODS
This real time PCR test (Qiagen/DxS) detects the most common activating
mutations in EGFR, which have been identified in human lung non-small cell
cancer involving codons 18-21, and leading to the following types of
mutations: exon 19 deletions (detects any of 19 deletions but does not
distinguish between the types), L858R, L861Q, G719X (detects G719S, G719A, and
G719C, but does not distinguish between the types), S768I, and exon 20
insertions (detects any of 3 insertions but does not distinguish between the
types). These mutations account for the vast majority of all activating EGFR
mutations. Using control materials that contain the L858R and exon 19
deletions, which account for ~86% of known EGFR activating mutations, this
assay has been validated to detect these mutations at a level of 1%. Purified
genomic DNA is extracted from microdissected tumor specimen, is analyzed by
low volume spectrophotometry, and then used as sample DNA in a real time PCR
assay using fluorescently labeled and non-labeled primers to detect wild-type
and mutated EGFR. Sample delta Ct values for mutant and control reactions are
calculated and compared against threshold delta Ct values in each mutant
reaction to determine the presence of each individual mutation type. Negative
and positive controls are assayed with each sample. The assay sensitivity is
estimated to be ~1% tumor involvement for each mutation type detected. 
METHOD LIMITATIONS: Tumor samples are non-homogeneous and data from a sample
of tumor may not be concordant with data from other sections of the same
tumor. Tumor samples may also contain non-tumor tissue, and DNA from these
areas would not be expected to contain a EGFR mutation. Although this assay
produces short PCR products, it may not work on heavily fragmented DNA. In
instances where the frequency of a target mutation is very low with respect to
the wild-type background (<1%), this assay may fail to detect the mutation,
leading to a false-negative result.

The tumors in the left lower lobe and the right upper lobe appear to represent two separate malignancies. The tumor from the left lower lobe demonstrates hstologic and immunohistochemical features which are diagnostic of squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the tumor from the right upper lobe is compatible with a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The slides from parts 1 and 2 of this case were reviewed by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY], who concurs the diagnoses.<MICROSCOPIC>
PART 1: LEFT LOWER LOBE
Sections through the left lower lobe biopsies demonstrate the presence of a malignant epithelioid neoplasm with squamoid features. The tumor is comprised of large, highly atypical cells arranged I variably sized solid nests and expansile sheets. The tumor elicits a mild desmoplastic and inflammatory host response. The neoplastic cells are large, with a moderate to marked degree of nuclear pleomorphism and abundant amounts of deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm. In some areas, the tumor appears to demonstrate intercellular bridge formation. No definite gland formations are noted. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Some areas of tumor necrosis are present.

The neoplastic cells are present in variably sized solid nests, and are comprised or relatively small cells with rounded to oval nuclei. Diffuse chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant to moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm. No definite gland formations or intracellular bridges are noted. Mitotic figures are easily identified. Some portions of the tumor demonstrate prominent streaming nuclear artifact. Foci of tumor necrosis are present.

  Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""right lung

AE/(3).
<MICROSCOPIC>
  Sections show fragmented pieces of lung tissue that are nearly completely
replaced by a non-small cell carcinoma. Neoplastic cells grow in sheet
like groups and are composed of cells with enlarged nuclei often with a
prominent nucleolus. Several mitotic figures are noted. The cell borders
are not well defined. Some cells have a slightly spindled appearance. 
The epithelial nature of these cells is confirmed with an
immunohistochemical stain showing diffuse and strong positive
immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7. There is variable but strong positive
immunoreactivity for TTF-1 which is typical for tumors primary to the
lung. The cells are negative with stains for p63 and cytokeratin 5&6. This
pattern would favor adenocarcinoma over squamous cell carcinoma. An
immunostain for S-100 protein is negative excluding melanoma. The
histology does not suggest a specific lineage of differentiation.

DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:
The neoplastic cells are arranged as dyscohesive cells and small nests of cells. They appear mildly enlarged with hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and indistinct nucleoli. The cells have minimal cytoplasm and show areas of molding and occasional mitoses. The neoplastic cells show moderate staining for pankeratin and very focal staining for synaptophysin. They fail to react with CD45 or TTF1. Flow cytometry studies fail to show a clonal B cell polulation; please see separate flow cytometry report (***PATH-NUMBER[1]). While small cell carcinomas are typically positive for TTF-1, the cytologic and immunohistochemical stains are otherwise very consistent with a small cell carcinoma.

BRAIN TUMOR: METASTATIC SARCOMATOID CARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN FROM LUNG (SEE COMMENTS).

COMMENTS:
The results of the immunohistochemistry panel for this poorly differentiated mixed sarcomatoid and epithelioid malignancy confirm the suspicion of a metastatic carcinoma (uniformly positive with pancytokeratins OSCAR), and given the provided clinical history, are considered consistent with a metastasis from the patient's known lung carcinoma. Spindle cell carcinomas of the lung typically show no expression of lung organ-specific markers (such as TTF-1), as exemplified in this particular case. Otherwise, there is no evidence for a melanoma (negative S100/HMB45), myogenic sarcoma (negative desmin), vascular sarcoma (negative CD34), or an astrocytic malignancy (negative GFAP).

<GROSS>
A.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled ""aorto-pulmonary window node"" is one lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The node is bisected and an intraoperative touch preparation is performed. The bisected lymph node is submitted entirely for intraoperative consultation, and the contents of the cryoblock are transferred to cassette A1.
B.  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled ""left lung for margins please"" is a 442 gm left lung pneumonectomy specimen. A shave of the bronchial margin is submitted fresh for intraoperative consultation, and the contents of the cryoblock are transferred to cassette B1.  The left pulmonary artery and vein margins are identified, closed with suture.  The pneumonectomy specimen also demonstrates two stapled parenchymal/vascular margins, one at the lower lobe and one in the upper lobe, measuring 7.0 and 4.0 cm in length, respectively. The stapled parenchymal/vascular margin on the upper lobe is removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked yellow. The stapled parenchymal/vascular margin of the lower lobe is removed, and the immediate underlying parenchyma is inked green. Located within the upper lobe, centrally and adjacent to the left pulmonary artery, is a nodular firm white lesion measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The lesion appears to arise from a main bronchus and appears to erode into a large segmental vessel that connects to the left pulmonary artery. The lesion closely approaches the overlying pleura but does not appear to invade into it.  The pleura overlying this mass is inked blue.  An second mass, measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm, consisting of an ill-defined nodular white lesion within the periphery of the upper lobe is identified measuring approximately 3.0 cm from the centrally located mass. The pleura overlying the second mass is inked orange. The lesion closely approaches but does not involve the overlying pleura. The remaining upper lobe is unremarkable. The lower lobe demonstrates emphesematous changes and is otherwise without discrete mass or lesion. Multiple hilar and segmental lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.5 up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: B1 - bronchial margin; B2 - left pulmonary artery and left pulmonary vein margins; B3 - vascular margins at surgical staples; B4 - first mass arising from bronchus; B5  B6 - first mass adjacent to large segmental artery; B7 - first mass adjacent to lymph node; B8 - first mass nearest pleura; B9 - first mass adjacent to stapled parenchymal margin; B10 - first mass adjacent to unremarkable lung tissue; B11-B13 - representative second mass in relation to overlying pleura; B14 - representative unremarkable left upper lobe; B15 - representative left lower lobe; B16 - five hilar lymph nodes, whole; B17 - two hilar lymph nodes, bisected (one is inked blue); B18 - two hilar lymph nodes, bisected (one is inked blue); B19 - two hilar lymph nodes, bisected (one is inked blue); B20 - two hilar lymph nodes, bisected (one is inked blue); B21 - two hilar lymph nodes, bisected (one is inked blue); B22 - one hilar lymph node, trisected; B23 - one upper lobe segmental lymph node, fragmented; B24 - one upper lobe segmental lymph node, serially sectioned; B25 - one segmental upper lobe lymph node, serially sectioned; B26 - one segmental upper lobe lymph node, fragmented; B27 - four lower lobe segmental lymph nodes, whole (one fragmented node is inked blue).


<COMMENT>


<MICROSCOPIC>
Slide A1, which contains an aorto-pulmonary window lymph node, shows recognizable lymph node architecture with a moderate number of lymphoid follicles having active germinal centers.  There is sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits and there are an increased number of eosinophils in the lymph node.  No primary or metastatic neoplasm is observed.  Slide B1 represents the bronchial margin of resection.  This slide contains the bronchial margin of resection.  There is focal sloughing of  respiratory epithelium.  There is no significant inflammation.  No neoplasm is observed.  Slide B2 contains the left pulmonary artery and left pulmonary vein margins.  The vessels show recognizable architecture with no neoplasm and no inflammation.  There is some blood clot in the vessel lumens.  Slide B3 contains tissue from the vascular margin at surgical staples.  This slide shows vessels and bronchi.  Neither shows neoplasm.  There are focal artifactual changes.  Slide B4 was stated to contain the mass arising from the bronchus.  The tumor is arising in or from the bronchus and is composed of nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells and some neoplastic spindle cells.  There are areas of inflammation and focal areas of degeneration and necrosis.  There are a few areas where the tumor appears to be forming glandular structures.  These findings would suggest an adenosquamous carcinoma or an adenocarcinoma showing variable differentiation.  The bronchus that is intact adjacent to the tumor shows mild inflammation in the lamina propria of the bronchial mucosal tissue.  It is otherwise essentially normal.  Slides B5 and B6 were stated to contain the first mass adjacent to the large segmental artery.  These slides contain tumor tissue adjacent to bronchi and pulmonary arteries.  The tumor shows large areas of degeneration and necrosis.  There are areas where the tumor appears to be forming glandular structures and probably producing mucus.  In other areas the tumor is in fairly solid sheets and could represent squamous carcinoma.  In slide B5, the tumor appears to show more of a squamoid pattern but does show areas of glandular differentiation.  There are areas of degeneration and necrosis and the tumor is adjacent to vessels, bronchi, and lung parenchyma.  Slide B7 was stated to contain the first mass adjacent to a lymph node.  This slide shows a vessel, a pulmonary artery, lymph nodes, and tumor.  The tumor is fairly poorly differentiated and shows large areas of degeneration and necrosis.  There are areas where the tumor cells appear to be forming tubular structures.  There may be areas where the tumor cells are forming glandular structures, producing lumens.  Slide B8 was stated to contain the first mass nearest pleura. This slide contains three pieces of peripheral lung tissue in which the pleura is identified. The adjacent tumor, in areas, appears to be within the lumen of a dilated bronchus. There are areas where the tumor cells are spindle shaped.  Slide B9 was stated to contain the first mass adjacent to the stapled parenchymal margin. The tumor is composed of nodules that are adjacent to lung tissue and pleura. The tumor is poorly differentiated and shows epithelioid and some spindle cells. There is prominent lymphoid tissue, which might raise the possibility of this tumor being within a lymph node, although that cannot be determined for certain. The adjacent lung tissue shows inflammation and contains dust.  Slide B10 was stated to contain the first nodule adjacent to normal lung tissue. The tumor is similar to that seen in most of the other sections, being composed of epithelioid and spindle cells. There is bronchial cartilage which would suggest the tumor is involving a bronchus. The adjacent lung tissue shows extensive congestion and hemorrhage and areas of acute inflammation.  Slides B11 through B13 were stated to contain tissue from the second mass in relation to the overlying pleura. These slides contain tumor that has the features of an adenocarcinoma.  Slide B14 was stated to contain tissue from an unremarkable section from the left upper lobe. There are two pieces of lung tissue on this slide. There is a fair amount of congestion with some hemorrhage. There are a couple of areas of ossification in the tissue. There are areas of dust. The other piece of tissue shows compressive atelectasis with dust and carbonaceous material. There ae areas suggestive of mild centrilobular emphysema. No neoplasm is observed.  Slide B15 was stated to contain lung tissue from the left lower lobe. These two pieces of lung tissue show congestion, focal compressive atelectasis, carbonaceous dust deposits in a bronchovascular distribution, and nonspecific inflammation. No primary or metastatic neoplasm is observed. There are areas of centrilobular emphysema.  Slide B16 was stated to contain five hilar lymph nodes. These are all relatively small lymph nodes and measure from about 2-3 mm up to about 5-6 mm in diameter. There is adjacent hemorrhagic tissue. These lymph nodes show sinus histiocytosis with dust. No primary or metastatic neoplasm.  Slide B17 was stated to contain two hilar lymph nodes that had been bisected, one of which was inked blue. There are four or five pieces of lymphoid tissue on the slide. These lymph nodes show no primary or metastatic tumor. There is sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits.  Slide B18 was stated to contain two hilar lymph nodes that were bisected, one of which was inked blue. There are five pieces of lymphoid tissue on the slide. These lymph nodes show a fair amount of congestion and hemorrhage, which is probably a result of the biopsy. There are lymphoid nodules with germinal centers. There is sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits within macrophages. This is fairly extensive. There is one silicotic-like nodule in one lymph node and it contains birefringent silicates. No primary or metastatic tumor is identified in these lymph nodes.  Slide B19 contains two hilar lymph nodes that were bisected, one of which was inked blue. There are four pieces of tissue on this slide. These lymph nodes show recognizable architecture with mild lymphoid hyperplasia and a fair amount of hemorrhage in the tissue, which is probably a result of the biopsy. There is mild to moderate sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits. No primary or metastatic tumor is observed.  Slide B20 contains two hilar lymph nodes that have been bisected, one of which was inked blue. There are four pieces of lymph node on the slide. These show recognizable architecture with mild lymphoid hyperplasia and a fair amount of congestion and hemorrhage in the nodal tissue. There are areas of sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits. No primary or metastatic tumor is observed.  Slide B21 was stated to contain two hilar lymph nodes that were bisected, one of which was inked blue. This slide contains two larger pieces of lymphoid tissue and two smaller pieces. These slides show mild lymphoid hyperplasia with sinus histiocytosis. There is a fair amount of hemorrhage in the lymph nodes and surrounding tissue. This probably is secondary to compression. One of the lymph node fragments contains a significant number of macrophages and large amounts of dust. No primary or metastatic tumor is identified.  Slide B22 was stated to represent one hilar lymph node that was trisected. This slide contains three pieces of lymph node. The lymph node shows recognizable architecture with fairly prominent lymphoid nodules. There is sinus histiocytosis with a significant amount of dust, most of which is carbonaceous. No primary or metastatic tumor is identified.  Slide B23 was stated to contain tissue from one upper lobe segmental lymph node that was fragmented. There are several smaller pieces of lymph node on this slide. It shows fairly prominent lymphoid nodules with active germinal centers. There is hemorrhage in the tissue. There is dust in the tissue and there is mild sinus histiocytosis. No primary or metastatic tumor is identified.  Slide B24 was stated to contain one upper lobe segmental lymph node that was serially sectioned. There are four pieces of lymph node on this slide. This slide shows recognizable lymphoid architecture with occasional prominent lymphoid nodules. There is some adjacent lung tissue. There is mild sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits. No primary or metastatic tumor is observed.  Slide B25 was stated to contain one segmental upper lobe lymph node that was serially sectioned. There are five pieces of lymph node and adjacent fibrofatty tissue surrounding it. These slides contain pieces of lymph node that show lymphoid hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, and dust deposits. No primary or metastatic tumor is observed.  Slide B26 was stated to contain one fragmented segmental upper lobe lymph node. This slide shows lymphoid hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, and dust deposits. There is some congestion. There is some hemorrhage in the adjacent tissue. No primary or metastatic tumor is identified.  Slide B27 was stated to contain four lower lobe segmental lymph nodes that were whole, one of which was fragmented and inked blue. There are three larger fragments of lymphoid tissue and one smaller lymph node. The lymph nodes show mild lymphoid hyperplasia and fairly prominent sinus histiocytosis with dust deposits. No primary or metastatic tumor is observed. The surrounding tissue does not contain tumor.

From those core biopsies, four air-dried Diff-Quik-stained touch
imprints are made. The core biopsies are then placed in formalin and
resubmitted in cassettes A1 and A2. (acb/jmk)

<MICROSCOPIC>
Examination of the touch imprints reveals a cellular specimen with
numerous atypical cells present in generally large somewhat cohesive
clusters. Occasional individual and small groups of tumor cells are
present. The cells show cytologic atypia with large nuclei containing
dark chromatin and sometimes prominent nucleoli. The cells contain
moderate amounts of cytoplasm. There is a pavement-type architecture to
the epithelial cells in the large groups. Extensive tissue necrosis is
present in the background.  The core biopsies reveal fragments of dense
fibrous stroma with necrosis and nests of malignant cells. The cells
show similar cytologic features with some indication of individual cell
keratinization. The findings are compatible with a squamous cell
carcinoma.

<FINAL DX>     

Left Lung, Upper Lobe, CT-Guided Core Biopsies (5):
  Poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma with focal squamous
differentiation (see
     diagnosis comments).

DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:
1.  As part of our quality assurance policy for the confirmation of new
cancers, the histologic sections of the specimen have been reviewed by
another pathologist, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], who agrees with the
diagnosis of a poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma that is
microscopically different from the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
in the patient's right upper lobe bronchoscopic biopsies obtained on
**DATE[Apr 15 2012] (pathology case ***PATH-NUMBER[2]). He and I both feel that the two
carcinomas are two separate synchronous lung cancers.

2.  The carcinoma in the current left upper lobe core biopsies has an
immunophenotype of a primary lung adenocarcinoma. It contains a small
number of scattered cells with squamous differentiation. The number of
cells with squamous differentiation is too small for a diagnosis of an
adenosquamous carcinoma.

mass was performed by interventional radiologist Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU]. The
radiology CT staff identified the patient as ""**NAME[AAA BBB]"", birth date
**DATE[Oct 19 1941], and Dr. **NAME[UUU] indicated that the patient had a recent right
upper lobe biopsy containing cancer. Initially, three biopsies were
obtained, yielding short slivers of white-tan tissue. One
Diff-Quik-stained air-dried imprint smear was prepared from each biopsy
and all three imprint smears were immediately examined by pathologist
Dr. **NAME[XXX M. WWW], who stated that the biopsies contained a
carcinoma. Dr. **NAME[WWW] also requested additional biopsies to optimally
compare with the patient's carcinoma in the right upper lobe. Therefore,
two additional similar biopsies were obtained by Dr. **NAME[UUU], neither of
which was utilized to prepare imprint smears. All five biopsies were
fixed in formalin and submitted for histologic processing in one
cassette labeled A1.

<MICROSCOPIC>
The histologic HE sections show scant cartilage, scant benign bronchial
mucosa, and fragments of variably anthracotic reactive fibrous tissue
with chronic inflammation and admixed with a poorly differentiated
nonsmall carcinoma. The carcinoma is composed of groups of polyhedral
malignant epithelial cells that are generally medium in size but include
very few large cells. The malignant cells have well defined cell borders
and have amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some malignant cells
have dense eosinophilic cytoplasm and questionable intercellular bridges
but no definite keratinization is seen. In addition, no definite
malignant glands are seen. The nuclei of the malignant cells are
round-oval, variable in size, and are either very hyperchromatic or
moderately hyperchromatic. The latter nuclei have small nucleoli.
Selected immunohistochemical stains show staining results of the
malignant cells that are consistent with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate
controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific
fluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or
all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based
method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin
free multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the
table below:

Napsin A  Positive  A positive internal control is identified.

Impression:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a pulmonary
immunophenotype.
Interpreted by:  **NAME[XXX M. WWW] M.D.
Comment:  The adenocarcinoma contains a very small number of scattered
cells that are p63 and cytokeratin 5/6 positive.  This feature is not
quantitatively significant and is not sufficient to classify the
adenocarcinoma as an adenosquamous carcinoma.

<GROSS>
Four specimens are received, each in containers labeled ""**NAME[BBB, AAA M].""
1.  The first specimen is received without fixative for frozen section diagnosis in a container designated ""1 right upper lobe lung,"" and consists of a 207 gram right upper lung lobectomy measuring 11.4 cm from inferior to superior, 10.5 cm from right lateral to medial and 5.2 cm from anterior to posterior surface.  The bronchial margin is identified, grossly found to be free of tumor, and sampled for frozen section diagnosis (1A).  The stapled vascular margins are identified and grossly found to be free of tumor.
A palpable central lesion measures 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  On section the indurated and gritty black-gray lesion is retracted at the cut surface and has focal anthracotic stippling.  The stellate lesion is poorly demarcated from the adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma and has spiculated borders.  The lesion is focally hemorrhagic, but no necrosis or central cavity is grossly identified.  The lesion abuts multiple large vessels, but no vascular invasion is grossly identified.  The corresponding pleural surface is smooth and glistening with no evidence of invasion.  The indurated mass is approximately 2.7 cm from the bronchial margin.  The lesion is 3.0 cm from a staple line at the inferoposterior aspect that grossly resembles an interlobar fissure.  The staple line is scythed away, orange inked for identification and represented in 1H.
The red-tan and glistening pleural surface has no evidence of perforation, exudate or adhesions.  Sections of the uninvolved parenchyma reveal a congested, deep red and boggy parenchyma.  The superior/apical parenchyma has extensive emphysematous change, as represented in 1I.  Two anthracotic pigmented intralobar lymph nodes range in size from 0.6 cm up to 0.7 cm, and are submitted in 1J.  One anthracotic pigmented hilar node measuring 0.4 cm in maximum surface dimension is represented in 1F.  Representative sections are submitted in ten cassettes.
Summary of section: 1A-bronchial margin (frozen section control); 1B-vascular margin; 1C and 1D-lesion with adjacent uninvolved parenchyma; 1E-lesion with closest approach to blue inked pleural surface; 1F and 1G-each has one longitudinal section of hilum; 1H-two sections of orange inked putative interlobar fissure; 1I-two sections of uninvolved parenchyma; 1J-uninvolved parenchyma with two interlobar nodes.
2.  The second specimen is received in formalin designated ""2 subcarinal lymph node,"" and consists of three ill defined and hemorrhagic fatty fragments ranging in size from 0.8 cm up to 2.1 x 1.0 cm.  The smallest fragment has a single stainless surgical clip attached, but the two smallest fragments are otherwise grossly unremarkable.  The largest fragment contains one anthracotic pigmented lymph node measuring 1.9 cm in maximum surface dimension.  The individual node is bivalved and the specimen is submitted in toto in two cassettes.
Summary of section: 2A-two small fatty fragments; 2B-largest fragment/bivalved node.
3.  The third specimen is received in formalin designated ""3 hilar lymph node,"" and consists of an ill defined and hemorrhagic fatty fragment measuring 2.1 cm in maximum surface dimension and found to contain three anthracotic pigmented lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.6 cm up to 1.5 cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto in casette three.
4.  The fourth specimen is received in formalin designated ""4 inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node,"" and consists of one tan-gray lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm, and submitted in toto in cassette four. (**INITIALS **DATE[May 28 12])


<MICROSCOPIC>
1. First of all, in specimen one the bronchial margins are confirmed negative for tumor, as is a vascular margin.  The tumor described grossly is confirmed to be infiltrating malignant epithelial neoplasm comprising gland forming tumor.  Glands are tubular to multiacinar and sometimes the cells form more solid nests.  The neoplastic cells frequently have clear cytoplasm and nuclei are large vesicular structures varying by a factor of 4 or 5 in size and having prominent nucleoli.  Extensive necrosis and reactive fibrosis is present.  Tumor invades the wall of large pulmonary vein but does not gain access to the lumen.  Focally lymphatic space invasion is suspected.  Tumor is remote from the pleura and does not invade pleura.  With the exception of sections 1D-1E of the tumor, all of the other sections from lung and hilum are devoid of malignancy. Peribronchial lymph nodes are sampled in 1J and are negative.
2. Specimen two is sections of lymph node with no metastatic malignancy identified.
3. Specimen three is sections of lymph node with no metastatic malignancy identified.
4. Specimen four is a lymph node with no metastatic malignancy identified.

  Lymph node, precarinal, endobronchial ultrasound-guided FNA (part A): No
  definite carcinoma; lymphoid cells and rare epithelial cells consistent with
  contaminate from bronchial lining cells.
  Lymph node, 4R, 4L, 4R-B, level 7 and precarinal, biopsies (part B-F):
  Multiple lymph node fragments with no carcinoma identified.<DIAGNOSIS COMMENT(S)> Fragments of scar and lung tissue are infiltrated by
  poorly diffentiated carcinoma forming nests and single cells without specific
  glandular or squamous differentiation. Immunohistochemistry performed at
  Cellnetix and reviewed at UWMC demonstrates diffuse expression of CK7 by the
  neoplastic cells (confirming epithelial differentiation). No immunoreactivity
  for P63, Napsin A, TTF-1, CK20 and CDX2 is identified. The immunohistochemical
  profile is consistent with a poorly differentiated carcinoma and is not
  specific for site but is certainly consistent with lung origin.
  The FNA from the precarinal lymph node contains rare epithelial cells which
  are interpreted as contaminate although it is difficult to exclude metastatic
  caricnoma; clinical correlation is recommended.

  somatic mutations in the EGFR gene in patients with lung cancer. This test can
  normally detect a heterozygous mutation present in more than 20% to 40% of the
  cells in the specimen.

Telephone preliminary results to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], **DATE[Mar 13 2012], 10:15 a.m.
DIAGNOSIS COMMENTS:
Immunohistochemical studies are performed on both parts B and D (station 7 lymph node transbronchial needle aspiration and right lower lobe endobronchial biopsies), and the tumor cells are uniformly positive for TTF-1 and Napsin A, and negative for CK5/6 and P63. This immunoprofile supports the histologic impression of adenocarcinoma.Consult
**NAME[YYY M. XXX], MD
FINAL DX:

a. 4R lymph node, transbronchial needle aspiration (smears and cell block reviewed):
-Positive for malignant cells, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma).

b. Station 7 lymph node, transbronchial needle aspiration (smears and cell block sections reviewed):
-Positive for malignant cells, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma).

c. Right lower lobe, lung, lavage (one ThinPrep slide and cell block sections reviewed):
-Positive for malignant cells, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma).

d. Lung, right lower lobe, endobronchial biopsies:
-Fragments of bronchial mucosa admixed with blood and fibrin showing focal non-small cell
 carcinoma (adenocarcinoma); please see comment. 
-Focal erosion with associated acute and chronic inflammation.
INTRAOPERATIVE DX:
A. 4R lymph node, fine needle aspiration (immediate interpretation of one smear): Numerous bronchial epithelial cells and a few scattered atypical cells, significance uncertain. 
B. Station 7 lymph node, fine needle aspiration (immediate interpretation of three smears): Atypical cells present admixed with numerous bronchial epithelial cells and lymphocytes, suspicious for non- small cell carcinoma.

Consultation: **NAME[YYY M. XXX], M.D.
MICROSCOPIC:
Part A - One wet-fixed smear, one fast-stained smear and cell block sections are reviewed. The aspiration contains numerous bronchial epithelial cells, many ciliated. Scattered within are clusters of atypical epithelial cells with relatively fine nuclear chromatin, round and smooth nuclear membrane and conspicuous nucleoli. Occasional large atypical cells with more clumpy chromatin and prominent nucleoli are focally present. These cells are consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. 

Part B - Three wet-fixed smears, three fast-stained smears and cell block sections are reviewed. The aspiration is cellular and contains many clusters and individually scattered malignant epithelial cells, some with nuclear hyperchromasia, irregular nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. Numerous ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and a moderate number of lymphocytes are present in the background. 

Part C - One ThinPrep slide and cell block sections are reviewed. The ThinPrep slide is hypocellular, while the cell block sections show rare clusters of atypical epithelial cells with large hyperchromatic and vesicular nuclei and occasionally prominent nucleoli; the later are consistent with rare groups of non-small cell carcinoma.

Parts B and D:
Immunohistochemistry Study:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies. Localization is via one or all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin free multimer immunoperoxidase method. Results are outlined in the table below:

Antibodies: Results:
Cytokeratin 5/6 Negative. 
P63 Negative. 
TTF-1 Positive. 
Napsin A Positive. 


Impression: Immunoprofile consistent with adenocarcinoma of lung.

<SPECIMEN(S)>
  A) Right upper lobe
<GROSS>
  Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""1"" is a 14.4
x 11.5 x 5.5 cm right upper lobe with lung, which is received deflated and
is profuse with formalin and further fixed. The pleural is pink with
patchy areas of hemorrhage toward the apex, anterior and inferior aspects.
The hilum demonstrates a 0.6 cm length of bronchus, as well as sutured and
stapled ill-defined length of blood vessel margins.  An 8.0 cm staple line
is present at the anterior-most point and leads to the hilum. Two 1.6 x
0.5 x 0.5 cm and 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm lymph node candidates are identified;
the thinner is easily fragmented and is consistent with more than one
lymph node candidate in a lymph node chain.  The specimen is serially
sectioned from posterior to anterior. A 2.8 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm tan and
glistening, ovoid and moderately delineated focally cavitated lesion
within the apex, which is 0.3 cm from the pleura and 2.8 cm from the
bronchial margin. This lesion does not grossly involve the adjacent
pleura, but there is an area of thickening and fibrosis at the apex
measuring 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm, which is consistent with fibrosis or
additional tumor, and appears to be 0.7 cm from the nearest tumor.  This
fibrotic area of the pleural apex is associated with the aforementioned
pleural patchy hemorrhage. The remaining cut surfaces are pink-tan,
crepitant and focally anthracotic parenchyma, with no additional mass
lesions identified. There is a darkened, black and erythematous area of
thickened pleura at the lateral surface, which is 3.5 cm from the lesion
and is well-sampled. 
Representative sections are submitted as follows: 
1) vascular and bronchial margins
2) fragmented elongated portion of lymphoid tissue
3) 2.0 cm bisected hilar lymph node
4) section of the lesion to the nearest pleura
5,6) one section bisected of the lesion to the thickened apical pleura
7) additional thickened apical pleura
8) darkened and thickened lateral pleura
9) uninvolved parenchyma.
<MICROSCOPIC>
  Bronchial and vascular margins of resection are clear.  Microscopic
sections are of anthracotic lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic
carcinoma. Sections of lung parenchyma demonstrate a cavitary squamous
cell carcinoma associated with marked acute and chronic inflammation with
organization. Interweaving between the inflammatory cells  are small nests
of atypical squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical stains for CK5/6 and
P63 are done on blocks 5 and 6 and highlight the tumor cells. Pleura is
fibrotic with scarring of the subpleural lung parenchyma but there is no
evidence of tumor involvement.",,,,,

<GROSS>
  A) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""#1""
requisition additionally stating ""right upper lobe wedge"" is a 33 gram
(formalin weight) 6.4 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm irregular portion of lung with
multiple complicated staple lines. The pleura is purple-tan, smooth,
glistening and remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.5 cm yellow-tan glistening
subpleural plaque.  This plaque-like lesion comes to within 1.0 cm of the
closest parenchymal resection margin and is marked with silver nitrate.
The staple lines are removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked blue
and the specimen is serially sectioned to demonstrate a moderately
delineated 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm mass lesion with homogenous white-tan
glistening and focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces. This mass lesion abuts,
distends the pleura at the aforementioned plaque-like lesion and comes to
with 0.3 cm of the closest inked parenchymal margin.  The remaining,
uninvolved lung parenchyma is brown-red, mottled, focally compressed but
otherwise grossly unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted in
blocks A1-A5. 
B) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and ""#2""
requisition additionally stating ""right lower lobe wedge"" is a 2 gram
(formalin weight) 4.8 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm wedge of lung with a 5.5 cm simple
staple line. The pleural is brown-tan, smooth, glistening and focally
ragged with membranous adhesions. No discrete lesions however are grossly
noted. The staple lines are removed, the underlying parenchyma is inked
blue, and the specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long
axis to demonstrate an irregular 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm indurated focus with
white-tan glistening cut surfaces. This lesion grossly abuts possible
vascular and bronchial structures and comes to with 0.2 cm of the
blue-inked parenchymal margin.  Additionally, the lesion extends to, abuts
but does not grossly involve the pleura.  The remaining, uninvolved lung
parenchyma is brown-tan, soft, spongy throughout. The specimen is
submitted entirely in blocks B1-B3.
<MICROSCOPIC>
  A) Sections show a fairly well circumscribed vesicular, cellular
proliferation of spindled cells which have elongated oval nuclei and
indistinct cytoplasmic borders.  The tumor is highly mitotically active
with up to 42 mitotic figures per high power fields.  Centrally there is a
fairly broad region of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor involves the
pleural surface but does not appear to involve the inked previously
stapled resection margin.  The non-neoplastic lung parenchyma is
atelectatic, shows vascular congestion and is otherwise unremarkable. 
B) Section show a polypoid bronchial proliferation of cohesive, monotonous
cells which have uniform stippled chromatin, small nucleoli and a modest
amount of light pink cytoplasm with some cells appearing plasmacytoid. The
tumor cells are arranged in sheets and trabeculae.  The polypoid
proliferation distorts the cartilage containing airspaces and incorporates
the adjacent alveolar tissue as well.  There tumor has a low mitotic rate,
no evidence of necrosis and no evidence of cellular pleomorphism. There
are areas of microcalcification. The immunohistochemical stains for
chromogranin and synaptophysin decorate the tumor cells and show floating
cells within alveolar spaces adjacent to the tumor and in a cross section
of an blood vessel.  This finding probably reflects tumor carry over. The
resection margin is negative for tumor (tumor is 0.2 cm from the resection
margin). The tumor does not involve the pleura (0.1 cm from the pleura).
The non-neoplastic lung tissue shows atelectasis, focal mucus plugging and
vascular congestion. The hyaline cartilage is focally calcified. There are
pleural adhesions. There is no evidence of metastatic leiomyosarcoma. No
lymph nodes are identified.",,,,,

EGFR MUTATION MOLECULAR (PCR) STUDY:
Testing performed by: **PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE, report
***PATH-NUMBER[2].
Interpreted by: **NAME[TTT SSS], M.D., issued: **DATE[Aug 17 2012].

Result:  Subcarinal Fine Needle Aspirate:  NEGATIVE for an EGFR mutation
by real time PCR.

Comment:  In this case no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations were identified by Qiagen/DxS real time PCR. This real time
PCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated
for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of
this assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that
this assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,
but as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to
other prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[RRR:

ALK GENE by FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH):
Testing performed by: **PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE, report
***PATH-NUMBER[3].
Interpreted by: **NAME[TTT SSS], M.D., issued: **DATE[Aug 19 2012].

Result:  Subcarinal, Fine Needle Aspirate:
     NEGATIVE for a translocation involving the ALK gene by FISH.

Comment:  Translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
gene have been described in a small subset of nonsmall cell lung cancers
and typically involve the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like
4 (EML4) gene, resulting in an EML4-ALK fusion gene containing the ALK
tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of an ALK translocation in a
nonsmall cell lung cancer tumor specimen predicts possible tumor
responsiveness to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug therapy. This assay
is not intended to diagnose a specific type of cancer but is instead
intended to provide information to help guide potential therapy. (**NAME[RRR:

<COMMENT>
The immunostaining profile on this case does not define a specific
primary site, but the fact that CK7 is focally positive and CK20 is
negative suggests that this is a lung, breast, or upper GI tract,
pancreatobiliary tree primary. Melanoma is essentially excluded. Breast
cancer is essentially excluded. Markers supporting a lung adenocarcinoma
(TTF-1 and Napsin) are both negative in this case. Further, markers
supporting squamous differentiation from any site (p63 and CK5/6) are
also both negative. The tumor does not show a small cell carcinoma

<COMMENT>
As part of our quality assurance policy for the confirmation of new
cancers, the histologic sections of the specimen have been reviewed by
another pathologist, Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], who agrees with the
presence of an adenocarcinoma with a pulmonary immunophenotype.

Performed by: **NAME[XXX M. WWW], M.D

<GROSS>
A CT-guided 20-gauge core biopsy procedure of a right lower lobe
pulmonary nodule was performed by interventional radiologist Dr. **NAME[VVV
UUU]. The patient was identified as ""**NAME[AAA BBB]"", birth date
**DATE[Aug 01 1938] by the radiology staff. Initially, three core biopsies were
performed, yielding slivers of pale tan tissue. One Diff-Quik-stained
air-dried imprint smear was prepared from each biopsy and the three
imprint smears were immediately examined by pathologist Dr. **NAME[XXX M.
WWW], who rendered the stat diagnosis listed above. To end the
procedure, additional core biopsies were obtained, none of which were
utilized to prepare imprint smears. The biopsies were fixed in formalin
and submitted for histologic processing in cassettes A1-A3. (ehk/jmk)

<MICROSCOPIC>
Histologic HE sections at different levels of the specimen show thin
pieces of tissue that do not include normal pulmonary alveolar tissue.
Instead, the sections show fibrous tissue with many elastic fibers and
with scattered malignant glands lined by single layers of cuboidal or
low columnar malignant epithelial cells. The malignant glandular
epithelium contains moderately large round hyperchromatic nuclei.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:
Deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate
controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific
fluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or
all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based
method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin
free multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the

PCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated
for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of
this assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that
this assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,
but as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to
other prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy. (refs:

**** Addendum ****

Reason for Addendum #1:  Immunohistochemistry results

<FINAL DX>     

A.  Liver, Fine Needle Aspiration with Cell Block Preparation:
     High grade carcinoma; additional immunohistochemical stains will be
performed for
        further subtyping.

B.  Liver, Core Biopsies:
     High grade carcinoma; additional immunohistochemical stains will be
performed for
        further subtyping.

<COMMENT>
The initial battery of immunohistochemical stains showing negative CK20
and CDX-2 results would seem to indicate that a metastatic colonic
carcinoma is unlikely.  The negative synaptophysin and chromogranin
stains would suggest against a neuroendocrine tumor, but there is a
proportion of neuroendocrine tumors that could be negative for both
markers.  The positive pankeratin and CK7 would be compatible with a
carcinoma.  Additional immunohistochemical staining for squamous cell
carcinoma will be attempted (CK 5/6 and p63) and the results issued as
an addendum to this report.  These results have been reviewed with Dr.
**NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Nov 23 12] at 3 PM.

Reason for Addendum #1:  Reference Laboratory Results

<FINAL DX>     

A.  Lung, Right Lower Lobe, Radiologically Guided Core Biopsy:
     Non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenosquamous carcinoma.

B.  Lung, Right Lower Lobe, Radiologically Guided Fine Needle
Aspiration:
     Non small cell carcinoma, favor adenosquamous carcinoma.

<COMMENT>
The slides confirm a moderately differentiated non-small cell carcinoma
with a predominantly sheet-like growth pattern.  Immunohistochemical
studies (see below) confirm a squamous phenotype with uniform CK5/6
positivity.  Focal areas appear to show some intracytoplasmic mucin and
vacuoles, and the lesional cells in one area of the tumor are positive
for Napsin A and TTF-1, suggesting a partial glandular differentiation,
based upon this small sample an intermediate grade adenosqaumous
carcinoma is favored.

Comment:  In this case no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations were identified by Qiagen/DxS real time PCR. This real time
PCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated
for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of
this assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that
this assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,
but as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to
other prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy. (**NAME[UUU:

**DATE[Jul 07 2012]) (Collection time: Not Provided)
Bone, right hip lytic lesion, biopsy: 
1. Findings consistent with involvement by a non-hematopoietic neoplasm (see
Comments)
2. No abnormal B-cell, T-cell, or NK-cell populations identified
COMMENTS
The presence of occasional atypical cohesive cell clusters on our
cytocentrifuge preparation, coupled with the flow cytometric identification of
a population of large, CD45-negative cells with uniform expression of the
epithelial cell adhesion (EpCAM) molecule (colored black in the first row of
flow histograms below), is consistent with involvement by a non-hematopoietic
neoplasm. The neoplastic cells represent ~1% of the viable cells analyzed in
this study. The neoplastic cells also express CD56, suggesting neuroendocrine
derivation; however, histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation will be
required for definitive classification of this process. There is no evidence
of a lymphoid neoplasm.
CLIENT REQUEST / CLINICAL HISTORY
Right hip lytic lesion - bone biopsy. Flow cytometry to rule out lymphoma.
(Per a telephone conversation with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Jul 9 12], the H&E and IHC
studies on the corresponding tissue are consistent with involvement by a small
cell carcinoma.)
RESULTS
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping after lysis of the erythroid cells reveals
that the viable leukocytes include 16% lymphocytes, 7.2% monocytes, 74%
maturing granulocytes, 2.5% blasts/basophils (1.4% CD34+ blasts), and <0.1%
plasma cells. The lymphocytes consist of 27% B cells (CD19+), 61% T cells
(CD5+), and 8.1% NK cells (CD5-, CD38+, CD56+). The mature B cells have a
mildly reversed kappa:lambda ratio of 41:56 in two separate assays, but do not
have a distinctly aberrant immunophenotype. The T cells have a normal CD4:CD8
ratio of 64:34. The NK cells have a normal immunophenotype.

Medullary Tumor, Biopsy:
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, see comment.

<COMMENT>
Metastatic adenocarcinoma involves approximately 5% of the bone marrow
space. There are areas of signet ring-type differentiation. The
immunophenotype is unusual for conventional adenocarcinoma, however, can
be seen with mucinous lung adenocarcinomas (Reference: **NAME[ZZZ M]. et. al.,
Primary mucinous (so-called colloid) carcinoma of the lung. The clinical
pathologic and immunohistochemical study with special reference to CDX-2
and MOC-2 expression. American Journal of Surgical Pathology 2004.
**ID-NUM). Mucinous lung adenocarcinoma is further supported due to
the lack of CDX-2 expression.

B.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and designated 'subcarinal lymph node #2' is a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm pink-gray lymph node candidate which is frozen entirely.  Intraoperative frozen section diagnosis:  Lymph node negative for carcinoma (LDB).  The lymph node candidate is submitted entirely for permanent in cassette B1.  
C.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right upper lobe' is a 255 gram, 15 x 9 x 4 cm intact right upper lobectomy specimen with attached third and fourth ribs on the lateral surface of the lung which in total measure 5.5 x 5.2 x 2.9 cm.  The parenchymal, bronchial and vascular resection margins are all intact with staple lines.  The pleural surface is pink-purple and dull.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue and muscle are focally adherent to the lung by a thin and delicate strand of fibrous tissue.  The third rib measures 3.8 cm in length x 1.1 cm in average diameter and the fourth rib measures 5.0 cm in length and ranges in diameter from 1.3 to 2.0 cm.  A firm palpable nodule is present on the pleural surface deep to the attached ribs.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue are differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical resection margins as follows:  Medial bone resection margin   black, lateral bone resection margin   orange, and surrounding soft tissue resection margin   blue.  The bronchial resection margin, representative section of pericostal soft tissue and representative section of underlying mass are frozen in two blocks.  Intraoperative frozen section diagnoses: C1)Pericostal muscle: Negative for carcinoma; Subpleural mass: No residual carcinoma in representative section frozen. C2)Bronchial margin: Negative for carcinoma (LDB).  The staple lines at the lung resection margin are removed and the underlying parenchyma marked with blue ink.  Sectioning reveals a 3.0 x 2.1 x 0.7 cm tan-white firm subpleural nodule located at the previously mentioned palpable nodule deep to the attached ribs.  The nodule is located 7.0 cm from the bronchial resection margin and 5.5 cm from the blue inked parenchymal resection margin.  The remaining lung parenchyma is purple-red, slightly consolidated with no other discrete lesions or masses identified.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue are placed in decal and will be gross and dictated later.  A single 0.5 cm in diameter pink-gray lymph node candidate is identified adjacent to the bronchus.  Sectioning through the ribs and soft tissue reveals unremarkable pink-red bony cut surface with surrounding tan-pink fibrous tissue and skeletal muscle.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  C1   remaining frozen section of nodule and pericostal soft tissue resection margin, C2   remaining frozen section tissue of bronchial resection margin, C3   vascular resection margins, C4 through C6   subpleural nodule submitted entirely, C7   uninvolved lung parenchyma, C8   single lymph node candidate, C9 full thickness section through third rib, C10 perpendicular section through lateral end of third rib, C11 perpendicular section through medial end of third rib, C12 full-thickness section through fourth rib, C13 perpendicular sections through medial and lateral ends of fourth rib. 
 
D.  Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'fifth rib' is a 5.1 cm in length x 1.3 cm in average diameter portion of rib with attached 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm soft tissue on the anterior/superior aspect of the rib.  The rib is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  Anterior surface of rib and soft tissue resection margin-blue, posterior surface of rib and soft tissue resection margin-green, medial end of rib-orange, and lateral end of rib-black.  Sectioning reveals tan-pink unremarkable soft tissue and skeletal muscle, with underlying unremarkable bone.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  D1 and D2 full-thickness sections through fifth rib, D3 perpendicular sections through medial and lateral ends of rib.  
E.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'posterior margin' are two fragments of bone measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm and 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm.  The fragments are entirely marked with blue ink and sectioned showing unremarkable bony cut surface with hemorrhagic marrow.  The fragments of bone are submitted entirely after decal with the bisected smaller fragment in E1 and larger fragment in E2 through E4.

C.  The grossly described subpleural nodule is entirely submitted in blocks C5 through C6.  Rare residual tumor cells are identified in microscopic foci best seen in slides C4 and C5, which are further evaluated by broad spectrum cytokeratin immunohistochemical stains.  In C5, one of tumor foci is present within a medium-sized vessel. Tumor is also identified in the decalcified sections of the 3rd rib (slide C9) with evidence of tumor extending beyond the visceral pleura as seen on an elastic tissue stain. Viable tumor in block C9 is also confirmed by a cytokeratin immunohistochemical stain. It is difficult to determine if the viable tumor cells extend into the parietal pleura, as the tissue planes have been obliterated by fibrosis. Elastic tissue stains are also performed on tumor blocks C4, C5, and C6.

Testing performed by: **PLACE, WA **ZIP-CODE, report
***PATH-NUMBER[2], issued **DATE[Jun 08 2012].
Interpreted by: **NAME[VVV UUU], M.D.

Result: Lung, Right Upper Lobe, Core Biopsy:  Negative for an EGFR
mutation by real time PCR (see Comments).

Comment: In this case no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations were identified by Quigen/DxS real time PCR. This real time
PCR assay has been validated to identify the most common EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations that involve exons 18-21. This test is validated
for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical significance and use of
this assay in other tumor types is not well characterized. Note that
this assay is not intended to diagnose any particular type of cancer,
but as an aid to clinicians, is intended to be used as an adjunct to
other prognostic factors to select eligible patients for therapy. (refs:

Interpreted by: **NAME[VVV UUU], M.D.

Result: Lung, Right Upper Lobe, Core Biopsy:
     Negative for a translocation involving the ALK gene by FISH

Comments: Translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
gene have been described in a small subset of nonsmall cell lung cancers
and typically involve the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like
4 (EML4) gene resulting in an EML4-ALK fusion gene containing the ALK
tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of an ALK translocation in a
nonsmall cell lung cancer tumor specimen predicts possible tumor
responsiveness to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug therapy. This assay
is not intended to diagnose a specific type of cancer but is instead
intended to provide information to help guide potential therapy (Ref:

As a consequence of this alteration, these adenocarcinomas are all associated with\X0D\\X0A\high-level `microsatellite instability' (MSI), the most common mechanism of which is loss of\X0D\\X0A\function of one or more of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins known as MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, and\X0D\\X0A\PMS2. Molecular testing for MSI or immunohistochemical studies looking for loss of\X0D\\X0A\expression of the MMR proteins are thus effective methods of screening for this unique\X0D\\X0A\subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas. IHC, particularly with the use of antibodies to all\X0D\\X0A\four major MMR proteins, can identify MSI adenocarcinomas with extremely high sensitivity\X0D\\X0A\and specificity. Furthermore, IHC analysis of the four MMR proteins can provide a highly\X0D\\X0A\sensitive strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation-carrying, early-onset\X0D\\X0A\colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, many of whom might be missed by using clinical criteria\X0D\\X0A\(e.g., the **PLACE Criteria) alone. IHC analysis has several advantages over MSI testing,\X0D\\X0A\as the latter is more difficult to perform, and does not provide gene-specific information.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Identification of this important subset of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data\X0D\\X0A\suggest that sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with MSI have a significantly better\X0D\\X0A\prognosis compared with those with intact MMR. In addition, several studies have suggested\X0D\\X0A\that MSI adenocarcinomas may be resistant to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Antibody/Clone            Marker For                    Results\X0D\\X0A\MLH-1/G168-728            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed\X0D\\X0A\MSH-2/G219-1129            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 002\X0D\\X0A\MSH-6/44                                   MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 0\X0D\\X0A\PMS2/MRQ-28                MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Detection System - Polymer\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE: Genetic counseling may be appropriate to explain the implication of this test results.\X0D\\X0A\A positive result, indicating loss of one or more MMR proteins, should be confirmed by\X0D\\X0A\sequencing that particular protein.

As a consequence of this alteration, these adenocarcinomas are all associated with\X0D\\X0A\high-level `microsatellite instability' (MSI), the most common mechanism of which is loss of\X0D\\X0A\function of one or more of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins known as MLH1, MSH2, MHS6, and\X0D\\X0A\PMS2. Molecular testing for MSI or immunohistochemical studies looking for loss of\X0D\\X0A\expression of the MMR proteins are thus effective methods of screening for this unique\X0D\\X0A\subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas. IHC, particularly with the use of antibodies to all\X0D\\X0A\four major MMR proteins, can identify MSI adenocarcinomas with extremely high sensitivity\X0D\\X0A\and specificity. Furthermore, IHC analysis of the four MMR proteins can provide a highly\X0D\\X0A\sensitive strategy for the identification of MMR gene mutation-carrying, early-onset\X0D\\X0A\colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, many of whom might be missed by using clinical criteria\X0D\\X0A\(e.g., the **PLACE Criteria) alone. IHC analysis has several advantages over MSI testing,\X0D\\X0A\as the latter is more difficult to perform, and does not provide gene-specific information.\X0D\\X0A\Identification of this important subset of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data\X0D\\X0A\suggest that sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas with MSI have a significantly better\X0D\\X0A\prognosis compared with those with intact MMR. In addition, several studies have suggested\X0D\\X0A\that MSI adenocarcinomas may be resistant to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Antibody/Clone            Marker For             Results\X0D\\X0A\MLH-1/G168-728        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Not Expressed\X0D\\X0A\MSH-2/G219-1129        MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00224\X0D\\X0A\MSH-6/44                     MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Expressed 00225\X0D\\X0A\PMS2/MRQ-28            MMR, Mismatch Repair         Protein Not Expressed **ID-NUM\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Detection System - Polymer\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\NOTE: Genetic counseling may be appropriate to explain the implication of this test results.\X0D\\X0A\A positive result, indicating loss of one or more MMR proteins, should be confirmed by\X0D\\X0A\sequencing that particular protein. MLH1 promoter methylation should be ruled out by\X0D\\X0A\appropriate testing, in cases which show loss of only MLH1 protein.

There is easily identified adenocarcinoma in-situ as well as superficially invasive carcinoma. Within focal areas the neoplasm extends through the muscularis mucosa into submucosa.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  It is noted that there is a peripheral rim of cauterized normal colonic mucosa, possibly indicating the lesion is totally excised.  The following staging criteria will be modified if additional specimens are received: T1 possible Stage I.  Histopathologic grade: G2, moderately differentiated.  Residual tumor, favoring R0, margins histologically negative. Histopathologic type: adenocarcinoma. The microscopic sections of the smaller polyp submitted in Block 2 shows evidence of a villoglandular adenomatous polyp.  There is moderate nuclear atypia with nuclei beginning to show evidence of prominent nucleoli.  There is nuclear crowding due to hypercellularity and pseudostratification of nuclei.  These findings are felt to indicate the presence of a high-grade lesion.  This polyp also shows evidence of a peripheral rim of cauterized normal colonic mucosa and, therefore, may be totally excised.   These findings should be correlated with clinical history and symptomatology.",Specimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1]. Tissues: Rectum. Specimen Comments:,,

The serosa is tan to\X0D\\X0A\hemorrhagic and displays a centrally located area of black possible\X0D\\X0A\surgical tattooing, measuring 12.0 cm. from the terminal ileum margin\X0D\\X0A\and 11.0 cm. from the opposing margin. Measuring approximately 5.5 cm.\X0D\\X0A\proximal to the possible surgical tattooing there is an area of the\X0D\\X0A\colon and serosa that is firm, focally adhesed and puckered around the\X0D\\X0A\entire circumference of the specimen.  The attached yellow to focally\X0D\\X0A\hemorrhagic, lobulated adipose tissue is up to 10.0 cm. in thickness.\X0D\\X0A\The wall of the appendix averages 0.2 cm. in thickness and the lumen\X0D\\X0A\has a diameter that averages 0.3 cm. and is filled with tan-brown fecal\X0D\\X0A\material.  The bisected tip is tan and unremarkable.  No abnormalities\X0D\\X0A\are identified within the appendix.  The wall of the terminal ileum is\X0D\\X0A\0.3 cm. in thickness and the mucosa is tan-pink with abundant folds and\X0D\\X0A\focal raised areas within the mucosa measuring 0.1 cm. in greatest\X0D\\X0A\dimension.  The ileo-cecal valve is tan-pink and unremarkable.  The\X0D\\X0A\wall of the colon averages 0.4 cm. in thickness and the mucosa is\X0D\\X0A\tan-pink with abundant folds and focal hemorrhagic areas.  The mucosa\X0D\\X0A\in the central aspect and previous area of possible surgical tattooing\X0D\\X0A\on the serosa displays black discoloration consistent with tattooing\X0D\\X0A\underlying the mucosa.  An irregular, indurated tan to hemorrhagic mass\X0D\\X0A\with central ulceration and markedly heaped-up borders is present and\X0D\\X0A\measures 7.0 x 6.3 x 1.2 cm.  The mass is circumferential, narrows the\X0D\\X0A\lumen to approximately 0.8 cm. and is present in the previously\X0D\\X0A\mentioned circumferential puckered firm area.  A small portion of the\X0D\\X0A\mass is grossly present towards the cecum and the majority of the mass\X0D\\X0A\is present in the ascending colon.  The mass measures 4.0 cm. from the\X0D\\X0A\terminal ileum margin and 17.0 cm. from the opposing margin.  The mass\X0D\\X0A\is located 2.0 cm. distal to the ileocecal valve. The serosa\X0D\\X0A\surrounding the mass is inked black and the radial margin is inked\X0D\\X0A\green.  The radial margin is confirmed with Dr. **NAME[VVV] and upon\X0D\\X0A\sectioning the mass, it is located 0.3 cm. from the closest portion of\X0D\\X0A\the mass.  The mass is tan-white and irregular on cut section and\X0D\\X0A\grossly extends through the wall into the adipose tissue.  The mass\X0D\\X0A\abuts areas of the inked serosa and possible extension through the\X0D\\X0A\serosa is possible, consistent with the previously mentioned puckering\X0D\\X0A\on the serosa.  The mass is up to 3.0 cm. in thickness on cut section.\X0D\\X0A\There are two tan-pink sessile polyps within the ascending colon\X0D\\X0A\measuring 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  The sessile\X0D\\X0A\polyps measure 5.5 and 3.5 cm. (respectively) distal to the mass.  The\X0D\\X0A\sessile polyps come to within 9.0 and 12.0 cm. from the stapled margins\X0D\\X0A\and are both located within the area of black tattooing.

Also received is an **DATE[Mar] specimen including colon, rectum and\X0D\\X0A\anus.  Attached vagina is present anteriorly.  Dr. **NAME[UUU] demonstrated the connection\X0D\\X0A\between the two specimens and the anterior portion of the uterus is inked blue for\X0D\\X0A\orientation.  The segment of bowel, including anus, measures 45 cm in length.  The proximal\X0D\\X0A\portion consists of colon and is closed with a staple line.  The distal end is anus\X0D\\X0A\consisting of skin closed with a suture.  The distal portion of the specimen is\X0D\\X0A\retroperitoneal. Anteriorly, located 9.0 cm from the distal margin is a 5.2 x 5.2 cm diamond\X0D\\X0A\shaped area of attached vagina with staple lines.  It has been somewhat torn but appears to\X0D\\X0A\entirely cover the underlying rectum and tumor.  A palpable mass is identified beginning\X0D\\X0A\approximately 8 cm from the distal margin with possible thickening of the distal rectal\X0D\\X0A\portion for a length of approximately 2.0 cm beginning 3 cm from the anal margin.  The\X0D\\X0A\specimen is placed in formalin for fixation and further dictation.\X0D\\X0A\\X0D\\X0A\Following fixation, the specimen is re-examined.  The fixed abdominal perineal resection\X0D\\X0A\specimen including anus, rectum and sigmoid colon in the fixed state measures 38.0 cm.  The\X0D\\X0A\distal 11.4 cm consist of lower rectum and anus which is totally non-peritonealized.  Near\X0D\\X0A\the lower end of the peritoneal reflection 12.0 cm from the distal margin, the peritoneum\X0D\\X0A\has been torn for a length of 3.5 cm.

The terminal ileum measures 12.0 cm. in\X0D\\X0A\length and is slightly dilated up to 4.0 cm. in diameter.  The large bowel consists of\X0D\\X0A\cecum, ascending, transverse, descending, and probable portion of sigmoid colon.  It\X0D\\X0A\measures approximately 100.0 cm. in length.  Approximately two-thirds of the colonic portion\X0D\\X0A\of the specimen is dilated with dilation up to 12.0 cm. in the cecum.  Immediately distal to\X0D\\X0A\the area of dilatation, there is a mass, oriented by the surgeon as at the splenic flexure,\X0D\\X0A\with puckering of the overlying serosa, adherent adipose tissue, and with a small amount of\X0D\\X0A\adherent pancreatic tissue.  Beyond this, the colon has an approximate normal diameter of\X0D\\X0A\2.0 cm. for a distance measuring approximately 30 cm.  The bowel segment is opened and is\X0D\\X0A\shown to contain abundant yellow-green liquid stool proximal to the mass and a small amount\X0D\\X0A\of formed dark green stool distal to the mass.  The mass itself consists of an intraluminal\X0D\\X0A\tumor which is nearly circumferential measuring 4.0 x 3.0 cm. on its surface.  It has\X0D\\X0A\central ulceration and rolled borders and is located approximately 30 cm. from the distal\X0D\\X0A\margin and approximately 100 cm. from the proximal margin.  The attached portion of pancreas\X0D\\X0A\and adjacent soft tissue contains a staple line at its margin.  The staple line is removed\X0D\\X0A\showing no obvious tumor.

The hemicolectomy specimen has a portion of terminal ileum that measures 6 cm in length.  The colon segment including cecum measures 16 cm in length.  The terminal ileum is associated with up to 3 cm of adjacent adipose tissue.  A long, thin appendix extends from the base of cecum, measures 7.2 x 0.3-0.4 cm.  Up to 1.8 cm of adipose tissue is associated with the appendix. The colon segment is associated with up to 2-2.5 cm of adjacent adipose tissue.

  The core biopsies from the left breast at 6 o'clock consist of cores of mammary tissue with extensive involvement by a poorly differentiated mammary duct carcinoma. The tumor is of nuclear grade 3 over 3 and is poorly differentiated (B R score of 8). In situ ductal carcinoma component is not seen. Focal areas of necrosis are seen within the tumor. 

ER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)     
Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: 
Deparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls. Localization is via a biotin-free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody. The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.

SUMMATION OF FINDINGS: 

The Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR-CLONE 6F11) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells showing 0 staining. The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO-Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells showing 0 staining. The Herceptest (DAKO) shows negative (0) staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0-3+ scale.

NOTE: Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.

Immunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. 

NOTE: ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3). Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1). Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.

Right Breast, Ultrasound Guided Needle Core Biopsy at 9:30:
Infiltrating Mammary Carcinoma with Mixed Ductal and Lobular Features, Histologic Grade 2 out of 3, Nuclear Grade 3 out of 3. 
See Note. 

NOTE: 
  The right breast ultrasound guided needle core biopsy is composed of multiple needle core biopsy fragments of tissue showing extensive involvement by infiltrating mammary carcinoma diffusely permeating the fibrous and adipose stroma.  Tumor forms solid nests and exhibits a single cell pattern of infiltration.  Individual tumor cells are pleomorphic, with cytoplasmic vacuoles and occasional signet ring cells.  No in situ carcinoma component is identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The tissue fragments with tumor range in size from 0.2 to 0.6cm.  

  E cadherin immunohistochemical stain is performed.  Some tumors cells are immunoreactive with E cadherin and others are negative.  This pattern is supportive of infiltrating mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features. 

  This case was reviewed at the Pathology Departmental Conference and was also reviewed intradepartmentally with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY].  Dr. **NAME[M. XXX] was notified of these findings on **DATE[Jan 7 2013] at 10:15 AM.

ER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)
Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: 
Deparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls.  Localization is via a biotin free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody.  The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.

Comment: Note is made of the provided clinical information and the patient's previous specimen, S09 13161, which is reviewed.  The patient's previous invasive poorly differentiated mammary ductal carcinoma is morphologically similar to the tumor seen in the current right chest wall excision and is, therefore, interpreted as recurrence of the patient's previous carcinoma. The current chest wall excision shows infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma extending to all inked visualized surgical resection margins and is seen infiltrating skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

Comment: The specimen shows residual in situ ductal carcinoma, solid type, nuclear grade 3 over 3 adjacent to the biopsy site and focally present at medial, superior, inferior, and anterior margins. The posterior and lateral margins are negative for carcinoma. Two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are seen which are adjacent to the biopsy site and measure 0.2cm (slide 1H) and 0.1cm (slide 1F). The margins are negative for invasive carcinoma, however, invasive ductal carcinoma is focally present less than 1mm away from the anterior margin (slide 1F). Immunoperoxidase stains for Actin and Myosin performed in two blocks, confirm the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma.

ER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)
      
Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1H) using immunohistochemical techniques.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: 
Deparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls. Localization is via a biotin-free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody. The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.

SUMMATION OF FINDINGS: 

The Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR-CLONE 6F11) is negative (less than 1% of the tumor cells show 1+ staining intensity). The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO-Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells showing 0 staining intensity. The Herceptest (DAKO) shows positive 3+ staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0-3+ scale.

NOTE: Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.

Immunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. 

NOTE: ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3). Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1). Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.

Received are seven containers labeled `**NAME[BBB, AAA M]. H000795112' with requisition `**NAME[BBB, 
AAA M]. H000795112'. 
The first is designated `left ureteral margin' and is received without fixative. It is a 
red-yellow tissue 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm which contains a white 0.2 cm tissue consistent with 
ureter, which has a less than 0.1 cm lumen. Intraoperative frozen section report by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] 
of: `Negative for carcinoma'. All tissue in AFS. 
The second is designated `right ureteral margin' and is received without fixative. It is a 
0.5 cm red tissue which is marked with ink and has a 0.1 cm lumen. Intraoperative frozen 
section report by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] of: `Proximal aspect negative for carcinoma'. All tissue in BFS. 
The third is designated `bladder and prostate' and is received in formalin with the 
specimen subsequently inflated with formalin and allowed to fix. It consists of a bladder 
which after formalin inflation is 11.0 x 9.0 x 5.0 cm and a prostate which is 4.5 cm from 
right to left, 5.0 cm from anterior to posterior and 3.8 cm from superior to inferior. 
The bladder is opened anteriorly and at 5.0 cm from the urethral margin surrounding the 
right ureteral orifice, is an exophytic papillated mass 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface of 
this appears grossly invasive and partially fills the lumen of the right ureter in a 1.5 cm 
zone. The more distal portion of the ureter appears grossly unremarkable. The remaining 
bladder muocsa has scattered diverticula but no areas of redness. The prostate is inked 
blue on the right and black on the left. The cut surface of the prostate is tan-pink tissue 
without grossly suspicious feature. 
No lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue.

The specimen consists of a 575 gram\X0D\\X0A\left kidney with attached perinephric fat and an 8.5 cm in length x 0.4\X0D\\X0A\cm in diameter segment of ureter.  The adrenal gland is not present.\X0D\\X0A\The kidney is 16 x 8.5 x 8 cm.  There is a large bulging mass noted\X0D\\X0A\within the superior pole of the kidney.  The perinephric fat and fascia\X0D\\X0A\overlying the mass are inked blue.  Sectioning the kidney reveals a 9 x\X0D\\X0A\8 x 8 cm well-circumscribed mass lesion which completely replaces the\X0D\\X0A\superior pole of the kidney.  The edges of the lesion are yellowish-tan\X0D\\X0A\and focally densely calcified.  The cut surface of the lesion is dark\X0D\\X0A\reddish-brown and friable and appears completely necrotic.  The lesion\X0D\\X0A\abuts the overlying renal capsule, but does not appear to extend into or\X0D\\X0A\through it.  The lesion does not extend into the overlying perinephric\X0D\\X0A\fat.  The lesion has a cortical location and does not involve the renal\X0D\\X0A\sinus or hilar vascular structures.  There are no other lesions\X0D\\X0A\identified.  The uninvolved renal parenchyma is red-brown with a\X0D\\X0A\well-delineated corticomedullary junction.  The average renal cortical\X0D\\X0A\thickness is 0.7 cm.

The tumor cells demonstrate cuboidal to\X0D\\X0A\columnar cytomorphology, eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm, and a low nuclear\X0D\\X0A\grade. The columnar cells that show clear cytoplasm also exhibit reversely\X0D\\X0A\polarized nuclei which can be seen in a special subtype/entity called clear\X0D\\X0A\cell papillary RCC. In addition, the immunostains have been performed, and\X0D\\X0A\the tumor cells are diffusely positive for CK7 and show weak incomplete\X0D\\X0A\positivity for CD10. Therefore, while the overall features are consistent\X0D\\X0A\with a papillary RCC, the possibility of a component of clear cell papillary\X0D\\X0A\RCC cannot be excluded. The positivity for vimentin is also noted.

The specimen weighs 66 grams.  The capsule, although intact, shows evidence of probable fibrovascular adhesions.  The outer surface is inked with black.  The specimen is serially sectioned.  A portion of the mass is solid tan-red and representative sections of this including the nearest surgical margins are placed in Blocks 1-8.  A significant portion of the mass is more friable, hemorrhagic, showing evidence of probable cystic degeneration. This area is represented in Blocks 9-12.  A representative section of the more solid appearing area is also placed in Block FS.","COMMENT WORD: The right thyroid is found to be replaced by large 7 x 5.5 x 3 cm. mass.  The mass is predominantly solid with focal evidence of degeneration and hemorrhage.  Microscopically the mass consists of variably sized follicular structures usually containing colloid.  There is mild nuclear pleomorphism with cells having enlarged nuclei with open chromatin patterns. Cytoplasm is moderately abundant and eosinophilic.  The mitotic rate is low.  Although no definite desmoplastic reaction is identified in the capsule, within multiple sites extension into vascular structures is found.  These protrusions or plugs into the blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells.  This finding of vascular extension is felt to indicate the presence of follicular carcinoma.  The follicular mass appears to be confined to the thyroid gland.  Staging criteria: T3 possible Stage II.  Histopathologic grade: G2, moderately differentiated.  Histopathologic type: follicular carcinoma.  Due to the unusual nature of the lesion, the case will be forwarded to **INSTITUTION **INSTITUTION for consultation and special studies as needed.",Specimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[2].

The mucosa is tan trabecular\X0D\\X0A\and focally calcified and the wall thickness averages 0.3 cm. No masses are\X0D\\X0A\appreciated. Representative sections to include the neck, body and fundus are\X0D\\X0A\submitted in cassette 1 following decalcification.\X0D\\X0A\Specimen 2 received fresh for frozen section labeled uterus with cervix,\X0D\\X0A\bilateral tubes and ovaries is an intact hysterectomy specimen with attached\X0D\\X0A\cervix and bilateral adnexa. The uterine body and cervix have a combined weight\X0D\\X0A\of 155.9 grams. The uterine body measures 6.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm, the attached\X0D\\X0A\cervix measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The serosa is tan/pink smooth and\X0D\\X0A\glistening. The ectocervical mucosa is tan and wrinkled and the cervical os is\X0D\\X0A\patent. The cervix and uterine body are bivalved to reveal a 3 cm in length tan,\X0D\\X0A\corrugated endocervical canal. The anterior and posterior endomyometrium is\X0D\\X0A\involved by a 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.8 cm tan friable mass with probable involvement of\X0D\\X0A\the posterior lower uterine segment. Sectioning reveals invasion into the\X0D\\X0A\myometrium. The invasion is grossly confined to the upper one-half of the\X0D\\X0A\myometrial thickness. The remaining myometrium is tan and trabecular with a\X0D\\X0A\single well-circumscribed tan intramural nodule measuring 1.5 cm in greatest\X0D\\X0A\dimension. The bilateral ovaries average 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm and sectioning of\X0D\\X0A\each reveals a tan predominantly solid cut surface. No suspicious cysts or\X0D\\X0A\nodules are identified. Sectioning through the fallopian tubes reveals a central\X0D\\X0A\lumen averaging 0.1 cm in diameter. A representative section of the endometrial\X0D\\X0A\mass is submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: 2A  frozen section\X0D\\X0A\residue; 2B  anterior and posterior cervix; 2C  anterior lower uterine segment;\X0D\\X0A\2D  posterior lower uterine segment; 2E-2F  anterior endomyometrium to include\X0D\\X0A\mass; 2G-2H  posterior endomyometrium to include mass; 2I  intramural nodule; 2J\X0D\\X0A\ right parametrial soft tissue; 2K  left parametrial soft tissue; 2L  right tube\X0D\\X0A\and ovary; 2M  left tube and ovary.  \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled right pelvic lymph node is a 5.0 x 5.0 x\X0D\\X0A\3.0 cm aggregate of fatty soft tissue.

The specimen measures 16\X0D\\X0A\cm in length and appears to harbor a fungating neoplasm on the glans penis. The\X0D\\X0A\penile shaft measures 2.5 cm in diameter at the point of amputation and at a\X0D\\X0A\point 4.5 cm from the glans the shaft becomes enlarged measuring at that point 3\X0D\\X0A\cm; and from there to the glans the shaft is swollen to 4.8 cm. In breadloaf\X0D\\X0A\sectioning the penile shaft at a distant 11 cm from the glans, there is a white\X0D\\X0A\nodule in the left corpora cavernosa that appears to be tumor. The tumor\X0D\\X0A\essentially replaces approximately 75% of the left corpora cavernosa. This\X0D\\X0A\nodule is visible in the left corpora cavernosa for a distance of approximately\X0D\\X0A\1.2 cm. Continuing to breadloaf the penile shaft reveals a similar white nodule\X0D\\X0A\present in the right corpora cavernosa a distance of 7 cm from the tip of the\X0D\\X0A\glans penis. Starting at approximately 5.5 cm, tumor is grossly noted to\X0D\\X0A\encircle both corpora cavernosa and the urethra and to essentially envelop all\X0D\\X0A\of the anatomic structures. From approximately 4.8 cm, the tumor is necrotic.\X0D\\X0A\The breadloaf sectioning is stopped approximately 3 cm from the tip of the glans\X0D\\X0A\and the glans sectioned parallel to the plane of the shaft. The tissue in the\X0D\\X0A\glans appears to be essentially replaced by necrotic tumor. A small amount of\X0D\\X0A\the foreskin is visible and appears grossly uninvolved.

This\X0D\\X0A\pattern argues against transitional carcinoma. A second panel of\X0D\\X0A\immunohistochemical stains including cytokeratin, inhibin, calretinin, ER,\X0D\\X0A\and P53 are performed to confirm a diagnosis of carcinoma and to exclude a\X0D\\X0A\sex cord-stromal tumor. The tumor is negative for inhibin and calretinin and\X0D\\X0A\is strongly positive for ER, cytokeratin and P53. While the tumor does not\X0D\\X0A\have the morphology of a typical serous tumor, some of the foci show nuclear\X0D\\X0A\clearing, particularly in the diaphragmatic and liver capsule metastases.\X0D\\X0A\However, P53 positivity is rare in clear cell and endometriod ovarian tumors.\X0D\\X0A\The findings are most consistent with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Since a\X0D\\X0A\large portion of the tumor is seen within the right ovary, it will be staged\X0D\\X0A\as an ovarian primary although the ipsilateral fallopian tube also shows\X0D\\X0A\considerable tumor.

A fimbriated\X0D\\X0A\trumpet-shaped fallopian tube measures up to 7.0 cm in length and 1.9 cm in\X0D\\X0A\diameter toward the distal one-half portion of the specimen.  Sectioning through\X0D\\X0A\the ovary reveals a cystic space filled with brown blood clot material.  The\X0D\\X0A\cystic space measures up to 2.0 cm in length.  Tumor extensively involves the\X0D\\X0A\external surface. Approximate weight of this tumor mass is 150 gm. Note also\X0D\\X0A\that there is a detached 7.0 x 6.0x 2.0 cm portion of blood clot.

The serosal surface shows patchy areas of\X0D\\X0A\hemorrhage and has a few fibrous adhesions.  The attached cervix measures 4.5 x\X0D\\X0A\4.0 cm in cross dimension and is covered by a tan focally hemorrhagic but smooth\X0D\\X0A\ectocervical mucosa.  The cervical os probes patent and the uterine cavity\X0D\\X0A\sounds to a depth of 7.5 cm.  The transformation zone is well demarcated.

The needle core biopsy shows adenocarcinoma.  Pulmonary parenchyma is infiltrated by malignant glandular epithelial cells focally forming malignant glandular lumina.  There is stromal desmoplasia in the background in reaction to this. Focal areas of cohesive cellular infiltrate are identified, in the minority pattern.  Most of the malignant cells are organized into nests with large malignant gland formation. \""Indian file\"" patterns are not observed.  There is a background of stromal desmoplasia and probably a background of parenchymal scar in the lung tissue.  Differential immunohistochemical stains are performed.  The CK7, TTF-1 immunostains are strongly positive in malignant glandular epithelial cells and the mucicarmine stain shows focal cytoplasmic mucin substance positivity. Immunostains ER, PR and GCD-15 are all negative.  It is noted that the patient's previous breast cancer (10-TC-3691) was ER positive at 4+ and PR positive at 1+.  In summary, the right lung nodule is most consistent with a new primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma, this supported by the immunohistochemical staining pattern and histologic evidence of a background pulmonary parenchymal \""scar\"".

The\X0D\\X0A\wedge of lung measures 10 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width by 2.5 cm in\X0D\\X0A\thickness. There is an obvious tumor eroding through the pleural surface on this\X0D\\X0A\wedge and this area of ulceration measures 3.1 cm in diameter. Cut surface of\X0D\\X0A\the pulmonary wedge reveals a whitish what is suspected to be tumor mass\X0D\\X0A\measuring 2.1 x 0.7 cm. Representative sections of this mass are submitted in\X0D\\X0A\cassettes 1A-1C and in cassettes 1D-1F are submitted the entirety of the segment\X0D\\X0A\of rib after decalcification.  \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 2 received fresh for frozen section labeled right chest wall margins is\X0D\\X0A\a 139.8 gram, 15.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm gray/white soft tissue mass including three\X0D\\X0A\segments of rib. The outer surface of the ribs are inked black and sectioning\X0D\\X0A\reveals a gray/white soft cut surface. The soft tissue mass has overall\X0D\\X0A\dimensions of 8.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm and appears to invade through the rib and abuts\X0D\\X0A\the black inked resection margin. No lung tissue is identified. A representative\X0D\\X0A\section is submitted for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 2A.\X0D\\X0A\Additional representative sections of the mass to include the rib and black\X0D\\X0A\inked soft tissue resection margin are submitted in cassettes 2B-2I following\X0D\\X0A\decalcification.  \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled chest right mass for permanent and\X0D\\X0A\consists of a small mass of tissue with an apparent muscular and adipose\X0D\\X0A\component. The tissue measures 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm. It is sectioned sequentially and\X0D\\X0A\submitted in toto in cassette 3A. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 4 received in formalin labeled head of fourth rib for permanent and\X0D\\X0A\consists of three masses of bony tissue having an aggregate dimension of 4 x 3 x\X0D\\X0A\1 cm. It is representatively submitted after decalcification in cassette 4.  \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 5 received in formalin labeled head of third rib for permanent and\X0D\\X0A\consists of a segment of rib measuring 2.1 cm in length by 2 cm in width by 1.1\X0D\\X0A\cm in thickness. The specimen is decalcified and submitted in toto in cassette\X0D\\X0A\5. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 6 received in formalin labeled level 10 lymph node for permanent and\X0D\\X0A\consists of a small mass of soft tissue grossly consistent with an anthracotic\X0D\\X0A\node. It measures 1.1 cm in width by 1.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in thickness.\X0D\\X0A\The specimen is submitted in toto in a single cassette 6.  \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 7 received fresh for frozen section labeled right upper lobe and\X0D\\X0A\consists of a 100 gram mass of soft tissue grossly consistent with a right upper\X0D\\X0A\lobe with multiple staple lines. The bronchial margin has been previously\X0D\\X0A\submitted. The lobe is breadloaf sectioned thoroughly and no residual tumor is\X0D\\X0A\seen within it. Representative sections of the vascular margin are submitted in\X0D\\X0A\cassette 7B and representative sections of random areas of the lung lobe\X0D\\X0A\submitted in cassettes C-E. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 8 received in formalin labeled level 4R lymph node and consists of a\X0D\\X0A\very tiny mass of soft tissue that has what appears to be a small tiny palpable\X0D\\X0A\node within it measuring approximately 3 mm in diameter. The specimen is\X0D\\X0A\submitted in a single cassette 8. \X0D\\X0A\Specimen 9 received in formalin labeled level 9R lymph node and consists of a\X0D\\X0A\small fragment of adipose with what appears to be a gross node measuring\X0D\\X0A\approximately 4 mm in diameter and is submitted in toto in a single cassette 9. \X0D\\X0A\**INITIALS","Microscopic Description\X0D\\X0A\Sections from the right upper lobe wedge biopsy show infiltrating poorly\X0D\\X0A\differentiating neoplasm with extensive necrosis. The neoplastic cells vary from\X0D\\X0A\epithelioid to spindled with large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli.\X0D\\X0A\Focal keratinization is observed. The tumor extends into the chest wall,\X0D\\X0A\involving the visceral and parietal pleura. Angiolymphatic permeation by\X0D\\X0A\neoplasm is noted. Sections through the rib show neoplasm within soft tissue\X0D\\X0A\proper. \X0D\\X0A\Sections through specimen 2 show the frozen section control to be free of\X0D\\X0A\neoplasm. Sections which include rib and surrounding soft tissue show evidence\X0D\\X0A\of neoplasm extending through the soft tissue and into the rib. The margin of\X0D\\X0A\resection is approximately 3-5 mm from the inked surgical margin. Again, areas\X0D\\X0A\of angiolymphatic permeation by neoplasm are noted. \X0D\\X0A\Sections from specimen 3 show infiltrating neoplasm similar to that described\X0D\\X0A\above within soft tissue. There is a 1 mm margin as can be best discerned. \X0D\\X0A\Sections through specimen 4 designated head of fourth rib show an area of\X0D\\X0A\reactive marrow containing neoplasm with background reactive marrow which\X0D\\X0A\includes some small lymphoid aggregates. \X0D\\X0A\Sections through specimen 5, designated head of third rib show reactive\X0D\\X0A\appearing bone with marrow which is normocellular and contains some small\X0D\\X0A\lymphoid aggregates. This is free of neoplasm. \X0D\\X0A\Sections from specimen 6 show a lymph node with anthracotic pigmentation and\X0D\\X0A\sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of metastatic neoplasm. \X0D\\X0A\Sections from the bronchial margin show no evidence of neoplasm. The additional\X0D\\X0A\sections of lung submitted show areas of pleural fibrosis and emphysematous\X0D\\X0A\change. There is no evidence of neoplasm. A single lymph node identified shows\X0D\\X0A\no evidence of neoplasm. \X0D\\X0A\Sections through specimen 8 show lymph node with anthrasilicosis and without\X0D\\X0A\evidence of neoplasm. \X0D\\X0A\Sections from specimen 9 show two lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic\X0D\\X0A\carcinoma.  **INITIALS",,,"Amendments:\X0D\\X0A\Electronically Signed Out By\X0D\\X0A\**NAME[CCC M.

The cells are large with abundant cytoplasm and centrally located ovoid nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent central nucleoli.  No attempts at keratinization are identified.  Tumor infiltrates within fibrous tissue and adjacent skeletal muscle fragments.  Tumor cells stain negatively with Napsin, TTF-1, and p63.

The\X0D\\X0A\specimen is received in fixative and consists of a 1.9 x 1 x 0.6 cm\X0D\\X0A\gray-black nodule.  The cut surface is anthracotic.  The tissue is\X0D\\X0A\entirely submitted in two cassettes.\X0D\\X0A\JMM:jlj","Microscopic Description:\X0D\\X0A\A)  The frozen section block of the tumor and permanent sections of the\X0D\\X0A\wedge excision demonstrates the presence of an infiltrating tumor with a\X0D\\X0A\semicircumscribed but pushing margin with focal finger-like extensions.\X0D\\X0A\The tumor shows areas of necrosis within a relatively solid cohesive\X0D\\X0A\infiltrative mass.  Individual cells are noted with relatively abundant\X0D\\X0A\eosinophilic cytoplasm and variable sized enlarged nuclei possessing one\X0D\\X0A\or more nucleoli and frequent mitoses.  The nuclei are somewhat\X0D\\X0A\eccentric within the cytoplasm in many of the cells.  There is some\X0D\\X0A\suggestion of intercellular bridging.  The tumor appears entirely\X0D\\X0A\confined within the lung tissue resection margins.  Adjacent to the\X0D\\X0A\tumor, the lung appears more atelectatic focally.  One section shows\X0D\\X0A\tumor cells spilling out within adjacent alveolar airspaces.  The\X0D\\X0A\closest approach to an inked margin is 2 mm.  There is no evidence of\X0D\\X0A\vascular invasion.  Some emphysematous changes are observed within the\X0D\\X0A\adjacent lung.\X0D\\X0A\B)  The B specimen includes a main pulmonary artery lymph node in\X0D\\X0A\multiple cross-sections.  This shows prominent aggregates of sinus\X0D\\X0A\histiocytes within the parenchyma.  The latter are somewhat soot\X0D\\X0A\pigmented.  There is no evidence of metastatic tumor within the lymph\X0D\\X0A\node section.\X0D\\X0A\C)  The C specimen, from the right superior mediastinum, includes\X0D\\X0A\multiple cross-sections of an additional lymph node showing similar\X0D\\X0A\sinus histiocytosis and soot dust accumulation within histiocytes.\X0D\\X0A\There are a few hyalinized small blood vessels within the medullary\X0D\\X0A\center.  No evidence of metastatic carcinoma is observed within this\X0D\\X0A\lymph node as well.\X0D\\X0A\D)  The en face bronchial margin of the resected right upper lobe,\X0D\\X0A\submitted as D, demonstrates benign bronchial cartilage and columnar\X0D\\X0A\pseudostratified mucosa without atypia and with some seromucinous glands\X0D\\X0A\within the surrounding connective tissue.  The proximal vascular margins\X0D\\X0A\are free of tumor and show only some mild atherosclerotic changes within\X0D\\X0A\the pulmonary arterial vasculature.  The more dilated airspaces show\X0D\\X0A\some mild bronchiolar metaplasia and are otherwise without remarkable\X0D\\X0A\features.  There is fusion of adjacent alveolar air sacs to form large\X0D\\X0A\cystic spaces.  The remaining lung shows lesser emphysematous changes\X0D\\X0A\but with a somewhat generalized saccular dilatation of several adjacent\X0D\\X0A\fused alveoli.\X0D\\X0A\Six lymph nodes in block D5, one trisected lymph node in D6 and a\X0D\\X0A\fragmented lymph node in D7 demonstrate similar sinus histiocytosis\X0D\\X0A\changes.  There is no evidence of tumor metastasis in any of the lymph\X0D\\X0A\nodes.\X0D\\X0A\E)  The E portion includes a lymph node with similar sinus histiocytosis\X0D\\X0A\changes and a large area of calcification apparently representing an old\X0D\\X0A\calcified granuloma.  This has a thin fibrotic wall.  There is no tumor\X0D\\X0A\involvement.\X0D\\X0A\F)  The final lymph node, F, shows similar sinus histiocytosis and soot\X0D\\X0A\dust anthracosis changes.

Case reviewed in Pathology Staff Conference on **DATE[Dec 24 2011].  The clinical and histologic features are best in keeping with prostatic duct adenocarcinoma with a focal cribriform, Grade 4 pattern in addition to an apparent more exophytic papillary pattern.  Prostatic duct adenocarcinomas may more often have a course approximating a Gleason grade 4+4, sum 8 form of the much more common prostatic adenocarcinoma of prostatic acinar derivation.  Only limited non-neoplastic prostate tissue is represented without representation of seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion as sampled.

The multiple fragments have features consistent with prostatic duct adenocarcinoma with part of the lesion having complex papillary formations with hyperchromatic nuclei with crowded papillary and glandular formations, likely associated with an exophytic portion. Other parts of the tumor have a focal cribriform back to back gland arrangement with glandular confluence and invasive features with general absence of immunoreactive cells for high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63 with only rare areas with some background non-neoplastic prostatic glands with some immunoreactive cells.  The lesion diffusely expresses prostatic specific antigen and in most areas expresses p504 (AMCAR) consistent with a prostate derived lesion.

  Prostate
  A. Benign prostatic tissue.

  B. Prostate tissue with small focus of atypical glands, suspicious for carcinoma. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial
       neoplasia cannot be excluded with certainty. See note.

    Note: Although these findings are atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic
              and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis. Repeat biopsy is recommended with 
              relative increased sampling of the initial atypical site.
              By itself, negative staining for high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63 in a small focus of glands, as
              seen in this case, is not diagnostic of cancer. The immunohistochemical stain for alpha-methyacyl-CoA
              racemase (P504S) is positive. However, this marker is also found positive in the majority of high-grade
              prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and occasional benign glands and mimickers of cancer. Therefore, a
              positive P504S staining does not equate to prostate cancer. Luo, et al, Cancer Res 2002, **ID-NUM.

Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW] and Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] concur with the diagnoses for C (atypical) and D (adenocarcinoma).  Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] has been notified. 

Note:  Although the findings in part C are atypical and may represent adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis.  The negative staining for p63 and 34BE12 and positive staining for AMACR in a small focus of glands is not diagnostic of cancer by itself.  This pattern of staining can be seen in adenocarcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and occasional benign glands.  Repeat sampling maybe of help if clinically indicated.

A.  Sections contain benign prostate.

B.  Sections contain benign prostate.

C.  Sections contain benign prostate.

D.  Needle biopsies of prostate demonstrate a small focus of glands with mild cytologic and architectural atypia, present at a distal tip of the biopsy core.  Immunostains for basal cells (p63, HMWK) are evaluated and demonstrate focal loss of basal cells in this focus.  In the context of adjacent prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), presence at the core tip, and small number of involved acini, this focus is interpreted as an atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), suspicious for carcinoma.

E.  Sections contain benign prostate.

F.  Sections contain benign prostate.

G.  Sections contain benign prostate.

H.  A core biopsy of prostate demonstrates a few glands with mild cytologic and architectural atypia, and focally prominent nucleoli.
